*Naval Arms Race mod overhaul (N.A.R.), made by the Baron --Major Powers-- beta 2.6  for UAD 1.6.0.6*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Naval Arms Race, or simple N.A.R., is a mod overhaul for U.A.D. that reworks several game mechanics with focus in historical accuracy. Adds new nations, ships and rework many others. Other gameplay improvements are also made where it is possible to provide a more enjoyable experience with more interesting choices for the player.

Special thanks to Nick Thomadis from the U.A.D. team, for all the help and the precious information shared, to NathanKell and his brilliant work TweaksAndFixes that gave me the tools I needed to expand what it is possible to do, and to all the players that shared feedback. It helped me a lot, some with interesting suggestions, others by reporting bug fixing issues.

Best regards, the Baron.

#,,Taf params,,,,,,,
taf_mines_max_tf_per_player,2,Max number of task forces that can be attacked by mines each turn (the same TF can be attacked any number of times by different fields and it counts only once),,,,,,,
taf_mines_max_tf_attacks_per_player,1,Max number of times mines can attack task forces in a turn (each attack against a TF is a separate instance),,,,,,,
taf_mines_max_ships_per_player,4,Max number of ships that can be attacked in a turn across all of the task forces of the player and all minefields,,,,,,,
taf_mines_max_ships_per_tf,2,Max number of ships that can be attacked in a single task force (across any number of minefield attacks),,,,,,,
taf_mines_fleetfactor_mult_war,2,Multiplier to fleet_factor when at war with the field owner,,,,,,,
taf_mines_fleetfactor_mult_peace,2800,Multiplier to fleet_factor when not at war with the field owner,,,,,,,
taf_mines_tonnagefactor_war,5,Multiplier to task force battletonnage when at war (this is used as a cap to minefield damage),,,,,,,
taf_mines_tonnagefactor_peace,0.04,Multiplier to task force battletonnage when at war (this is used as a cap to minefield damage),,,,,,,
taf_mines_max_randomdamagefactor,300000,This is the from value when remapping damage to number of ships hit. The damage is a random value between fleet_factor to tonnagefactor times field radius divided by detection value,,,,,,,
taf_mines_default_max_ships_per_tf,10,When the random damage value is taf_mines_max_randomdamagefactor it gets remapped to this number of ships. A higher value will map to a higher number of ships, there is no clamping,,,,,,
taf_mines_antimine_min,0.05,The min value to use for the antimine tech,,,,,,,
taf_mines_antimine_max,10,The max value to use for the antimine tech,,,,,,,
taf_mines_ship_damage_percent_min,1,The minimum percent damage to apply to the ship when it hits a mine,,,,,,,
taf_mines_ship_damage_percent_max,200,The maximum percent damage to apply to the ship when it hits a mine. This is before being multiplied by the dmg_factor_ships and by antimine and by the minefield damage mult. Values above 100 are clamped to 100 which means that the default range of 1 to 200 means half the time the ship is sunk and half the time it takes random damage between 1 and 100 percent,,,,,,,
taf_mines_crew_damage_percent_min,5,The minimum percent damage to the crew of the ship,,,,,,,
taf_mines_crew_damage_percent_max,35,The maximum percent damage to the crew of the ship. This is before being multiplied by the dmg_factor_crew and by antimine and by the minefield damage mult.,,,,,,,
taf_shareddesign_maxYearsIntoFuture,5,the maximum number of years ahead of the current year where a design will be considered. Default 10.,,,,,,,
taf_shareddesign_yearsInPastForSplit,5,ships beyond this number of years in the past will be placed in a lower priority bucket to be used only if there are no newer ships, or some of these ships are very close to the oldest new ship. Default 5.,,,,,,
taf_shareddesign_yearClosenessAroundSplit,3,if an older ship's creation date is closer than this to the oldest new ship it is included as well. Default 3.,,,,,,,
taf_shareddesign_bestTechValue,0.9,if at least one ship has greater than this tech commonality that set of ships will be randomly selected from as the shared design. Default 0.9,,,,,,,
taf_shareddesign_okTechValue,0.75,if there are no best ships any ships with greater tech commonality than this will be the next selection group. Default 0.75.,,,,,,,
taf_shareddesign_minTechValue,0.5,if no better ships are available any ships with greater tech commonality than this will be the final selection group. If no ships make even this level of commonality no shared design is returned. Default 0.5. Lastly when 1890 is the selected year in the shared design constructor only actual starting techs will be enabled for the ship rather than any tech with 1890 as its year. This prevents 1890 shared designs being actually unavailable to the AI on campaign start.,,,,,,,
taf_scrap_enable,0,,,,,,,,
taf_scrap_buildTimeCoeff,1,the coefficient to build time,,,,,,,
taf_scrap_mothballScoreAddYears,5,the score to add when a ship is mothballed,,,,,,,
taf_scrap_hysteresis,50000,In order to not scrap every turn the AI will only scrap when its fleet tonnage is greater than its scrap target plus this. Once scrapping it will scrap down to the scrap target however.,,,,,,,
taf_scrap_capacityExponent,0.7,an exponent to shipyard capacity. This is multiplied by the Coeff to get the scrap target tonnage.,,,,,,,
taf_scrap_capacityCoeff,40,target tonnage is min_fleet_tonnage_for_scrap plus the coeff times (shipyard capacity to the capacity Exponent power).,,,,,,,
