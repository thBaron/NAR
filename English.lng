$event_text_1;A foreign journalist approached you asking about a high-ranking person from [FRIEND]'s Admiralty?
$event_text_1_a;You never heard of him.
$event_text_1_b;Refrain from commenting.
$event_text_1_c;You believe he is an outstanding officer and an acquaintance with him would be an honor.
$event_text_10;There is a military crisis in [MINOR]. [ENEMY] has sent a fleet, in order to enforce their own puppet-ruler. The government wonders if we should interfere?
$event_text_10_a;Send one of our cruisers for surveillance.
$event_text_10_b;Send a full division to demonstrate the strength of our nation and our willingness to restore order with military means.
$event_text_10_c;Ignore.
$event_text_11;Our fishermen complain that they are getting harassed by [ENEMY]'s military ships in every possible way. The government asks you how to respond?
$event_text_11_a;Send an official protest.
$event_text_11_b;Send a naval squadron to protect our fishermen.
$event_text_12;Our shipping companies began to complain about additional restrictions of [ENEMY] when passing the Suez Canal. What should we do?
$event_text_12_a;Make an official protest.
$event_text_12_b;Send a fleet to demonstrate our intent to protect the rights of our companies.
$event_text_13;[ENEMY] increases its Navy budget considerably. How should we respond?
$event_text_13_a;We must also increase our Navy's budget to counter their actions.
$event_text_13_b;Our fleet is sufficiently strong, so we don't need to increase our naval expenditures.
$event_text_13_c;Our Navy's budget is already too high. We need to invest more in our country's economy.
$event_text_14;Our country has increased its financial growth and tax income is booming. Our prime minister asks your opinion on where to allocate the extra finances.
$event_text_14_a;Of course spend more on the development of our fleet!
$event_text_14_b;Invest in Industry. This could pay off in the long term for our economy.
$event_text_14_c;Spend on social needs. Our people will surely appreciate it and support more our policies.
$event_text_15;The recent financial crisis in industry has decreased tax income. The government wants to cut the Navy's budget. What is your reaction?
$event_text_15_a;This is unacceptable! The Navy's finances must be maintained at all costs!
$event_text_15_b;Our Navy belongs to the country and its people, so is ready to give its share for the common good.
$event_text_15_c;Ask the ministers to cut their own appetite and salaries.
$event_text_16;You visited an international weapons exhibition and journalists asked about your impressions.
$event_text_16_a;You were not particularly interested. Our industry can produce much better weapons but we cannot yet demonstrate them because they are secretly developed. [ENEMIES]
$event_text_16_b;Some of the weapon exhibits were fascinating and superior to our own, so we will consider adding them to our arsenal.
$event_text_16_c;You realized that our Country is keeping pace with global military developments and our own weapons are at least equally good.
$event_text_17;One of our spies has been caught in [ENEMY] but he managed to escape, bringing to us valuable secret information. The Intelligence Service suggests publicly celebrating this successful event, but your approval is needed.
$event_text_17_a;You forbid any formal celebration because it would worsen our relations with [ENEMY]. Our agents' actions must remain hidden.
$event_text_17_b;Reward officially our agent but without mentioning the full intent of his mission.
$event_text_17_c;Celebrate our agent's success publicly and with full press coverage. Our youngsters need a heroic example such as this one.
$event_text_18;A person has been arrested with strong evidence that he was spying on our country. The Minister of Foreign Affairs asked you how he should act at a diplomatic level?
$event_text_18_a;It is not yet known for whom he works, so it is advised to hide this matter from publicity.
$event_text_18_b;Accuse [ENEMY] for foreign espionage.
$event_text_18_c;Accuse [FRIEND] for foreign espionage.
$event_text_19;[ENEMY] presented to us an ultimatum demanding the extradition of a defector who requests an amnesty from our country. The Minister of Justice asks for your advice about this situation.
$event_text_19_a;Say no! He may share valuable information about [ENEMY].
$event_text_19_b;Return him to them! We should not risk causing more tension between our countries.
$event_text_19_c;Negotiate to exchange him with something valuable to us.
$event_text_2;During a foreign visit in [ENEMY], our Finance Minister received a severe blow on his head by protesters. What are your comments?
$event_text_2_a;Express your concern through diplomatic channels and demand the punishment of the perpetrators.
$event_text_2_b;Make a diplomatic protest and increase military forces near [ENEMY]'s shores.
$event_text_2_c;These things happen and we should not risk increasing the tension between our countries.
$event_text_20;The Minister of Finance believes that the fleet needs more Destroyers. He is ready to allocate adequate funds for the construction of Destroyers.
$event_text_20_a;Agree with the Minister's opinion.[ENEMIES]
$event_text_20_b;Explain that our Destroyers are enough and the fleet needs money for other requirements.
$event_text_20_c;He should better not interfere in Navy's matters.
$event_text_21;The Minister of Foreign Affairs believes that the fleet needs more cruisers. He would support the raising of adequate funds for the construction of Cruisers.
$event_text_21_a;Agree with the Minister's opinion.
$event_text_21_b;Explain that our Cruisers are enough and the fleet needs money for other requirements.
$event_text_22;The Press is concerned about our country's defense capability and demands the construction of an additional battleship. All members of the government are gathered to discuss the issue.
$event_text_22_a;You agree that we need one more battleship!
$event_text_22_b;You believe that there are enough battleships to defend our seas and the Navy needs money for other requirements.
$event_text_22_c;The Press should not interfere with the Navy's business! We know our job better than them!
$event_text_23;There is a military crisis in [MINOR]. The government suggests using the current situation to strengthen our own influence in the region. What do you think?
$event_text_23_a;Send our diplomats to help them find a peaceful solution.
$event_text_23_b;Send a Division to demonstrate our naval power.
$event_text_23_c;The fleet is not ready for action in that region. We have other, more important matters to solve.
$event_text_24;Industrialists who are impressed by our Navy are ready to invest for the needs of the fleet. What is your answer?
$event_text_24_a;The Navy will certainly appreciate the extra funds!
$event_text_24_b;Better to invest their money in the development of industrial infrastructures. The country's economy needs more growth!
$event_text_24_c;Our times are difficult. Donating money to the poor or allocating them for social needs would be an invaluable act of humanism.
$event_text_25;Several of our country's shipbuilding industries are constructing warships for third countries. What is your opinion?
$event_text_25_a;Any business cooperation with third countries improves our bilateral relations and strengthens our defense industry in the long term. [ENEMIES] [FRIENDS]
$event_text_25_b;Permit such cooperation but in a limited scope, in order to not leak our secret technologies.
$event_text_25_c;You are categorically against this practice that could strengthen our future rivals. [ENEMIES]
$event_text_26;Some of our industrialists want to invest in the modernization of [ENEMY]'s shipyards. What is your opinion?
$event_text_26_a;Any cooperation should be mutually beneficial. We should also call [ENEMY]"s businessmen to invest in our shipbuilding.
$event_text_26_b;It would be better to modernize our own shipbuilding complexes.
$event_text_26_c;Unacceptable behavior in view of the fact that [ENEMY] is one of our main rivals at sea.
$event_text_27;Large industrialists proposed a redistribution of the Government's budget in favor of the industrial sector at the expense of the Army and Navy budgets. What is your reaction?
$event_text_27_a;Army matters are not of your concern but you know for certain that the Navy's budget should stay as it is!
$event_text_27_b;These business people are ready to sell their homeland for some extra cents. The government should not listen to them and support the Navy more!
$event_text_27_c;You feel unauthorised to interfere in the Government's financial policy.
$event_text_28;An influential and good looking lady from [FRIEND] asks for your audience to discuss the seafaring business. It might be beneficial in all kind of ways. What is your decision?
$event_text_28_a;Of course, immediately invite her in. For the next 2 hours, please do not disturb me. I will be busy with diplomatic affairs...
$event_text_28_b;I am now very busy with Navy matters. Please kindly reject this meeting.
$event_text_28_c;I'm an old soldier and don't have time to meet with young girls. Besides that, I am married and do not want to risk a potential wife grumbling for any reason!
$event_text_29;The government asks your opinion about submarines.
$event_text_29_a;You believe they are extremely limited in their operational usefulness, therefore there is no need to invest more on submarines warfare.
$event_text_29_b;The submarine is a promising weapon that will revolutionize naval tactics. We must fund more of our submarine development projects! [ENEMIES]
$event_text_29_c;Enemy submarines could seriously threaten our merchant ships, so we should also build more Destroyers for defending our coasts. [ENEMIES]
$event_text_3;A dysentery epidemic broke out in Africa and the government asks your opinion about sending medical ships to help those people.
$event_text_3_a;You agree. We should try to prevent this disease from expanding to our territories in any possible way.
$event_text_3_b;It would be better to avoid a premature involvement in this incident but express your sincere worrying.
$event_text_3_c;You strongly disagree. You don't want to risk a contamination of our ships.
$event_text_30;Journalists are interested in your opinion about the new prime minister who came into power in "[FRIEND]".
$event_text_30_a;I do not know anything about him.
$event_text_30_b;I think that his offensive policy over other nations will threaten the relationship between our countries.
$event_text_30_c;I believe he is a decent person and a first-class politician who will improve our bilateral relations.
$event_text_31;At a press conference, the journalists asked you a question about the new torpedoes that might soon be added in the Navy's arsenal. Your answer is?
$event_text_31_a;I do not comment on rumors.
$event_text_31_b;The new torpedoes will not be available in the near future. We are completely satisfied with the old ones as long as we have peace. [FRIENDS][ENEMIES]
$event_text_31_c;Indeed we are willing to acquire these torpedoes as a possible countermeasure against [ENEMY]'s new ships.
$event_text_32;At a press conference, journalists questioned the combat ability of the fleet. What is your reply?
$event_text_32_a;The fleet is capable at any time to perform the tasks assigned to it.
$event_text_32_b;There is a need for additional support from the government to maintain the combat capability of our fleet.
$event_text_32_c;We are working on modernizing our fleet so that our Navy can soon become the strongest in the world! [ENEMIES]
$event_text_33;At a press conference you were asked about recent evidence that foreign espionage targets our Navy. How do you respond?
$event_text_33_a;Ignore this question of the journalists.
$event_text_33_b;Intrigue them by mixing [ENEMY]'s involvement in this case.
$event_text_33_c;Refer to the matter as a constructed rumour made for internal political games.
$event_text_34;At a press conference, journalists asked you a question about the foreign policy of [ENEMY]'s government. What is your answer?
$event_text_34_a;[ENEMY] has an adventurous policy that often conflicts with our own interests.
$event_text_34_b;[ENEMY]'s government is reasonable, contributing to the strengthening of relations between our countries.
$event_text_34_c;You diplomatically redirect the question to the Foreign Policy department.
$event_text_35;The Prime Minister believes that our Navy's crew training level is inadequate. How do you respond to his opinion?
$event_text_35_a;You agree and persuade him to allocate more funds for Navy training specialists and other needed materials.
$event_text_35_b;You disagree and convince him that our Navy's crew is more than ready to defend the country.
$event_text_35_c;You advise him to deal with the Government's corruption problems and not interfere in Navy's procedures.
$event_text_36;In anticipation of the World Disarmament Conference, the government wants to know what our position will be.
$event_text_36_a;You are in favor of a general disarmament and the reduction of maximum ship displacement by 10%.
$event_text_36_b;You are in favor of a general disarmament and the reduction of maximum ship displacement by 20%.
$event_text_36_c;You are against disarmament! Our total sum of warships displacement is lower in comparison to other countries.
$event_text_37;During a diplomatic mission, a private communication between our young diplomat and the married daughter of XX's Minister of Foreign Affairs created a misunderstanding. Some Journalists asked your opinion about this.
$event_text_37_a;May they live happily ever after!
$event_text_37_b;Strongly criticize our diplomat's behaviour and announce that he is going to be removed from service.
$event_text_37_c;Such trifles should not affect the good diplomatic relations between our countries.
$event_text_38;During a state dinner in [FRIEND] there was a heated discussion between our ambassador and members of [FRIEND]'s government. The Prime Minister asks you how we could best handle this embarrassing situation?
$event_text_38_a;You think that our ambassador was trying to defend our country's rights.
$event_text_38_b;Immediately recall the ambassador for consultation.
$event_text_38_c;Apologize through diplomatic channels and provide some compensation. [FRIEND_MONEY]
$event_text_39;Some newspapers are involving you in an erotic scandal. What are your comments?
$event_text_39_a;Deny that it was you.
$event_text_39_b;You are the head of our nation's fleet and demand their punishment for those insulting rumours about your person.
$event_text_39_c;It is not your fault that you are attractive.
$event_text_4;During a scientific trip, a well-known oceanographer from [ENEMY] was killed by the natives. What are your comments?
$event_text_4_a;Express condolences to his family and his country.
$event_text_4_b;Forbid our citizens to visit this dangerous place.
$event_text_4_c;Comment that after [ENEMY]'s extremities in their lands, such incidents were expected.
$event_text_40;During a naval exercise one of our battleships suffered an engine breakdown. The journalists ask you about this. How do you reply?
$event_text_40_a;Indicate that we need to trust our own industry and not rely on machinery bought from [FRIEND].
$event_text_40_b;It was an accident that will not happen again if our crew continues to receive training of the highest standard.
$event_text_40_c;You don't regard this as a serious incident.
$event_text_41;Our Intelligence Service suggests sending our fleet to assist the overthrowing of AA's illegal government. If the coup is successful we have a chance of controlling this region. The Prime Minister asks about your opinion.
$event_text_41_a;I fully support this. Controlling this region would increase our country's revenues.
$event_text_41_b;A coup d'état cannot be bloodless. You urge for a peaceful handling of the situation.
$event_text_41_c;The fleet should not involve but keep forces ready against any possible enemy.
$event_text_42;Our Espionage suggests to use a portion of the Naval budget to fund extremist and terrorist operations in [ENEMY]. What is your reaction?
$event_text_42_a;Spreading chaos within [ENEMY] would be very helpful in case of a military confrontation between our countries. You agree!
$event_text_42_b;The fleet needs these resources to be ready for war.
$event_text_42_c;You are against such dishonest actions.
$event_text_43;Military awareness is spreading across the world. The government wishes to demonstrate our power by conducting naval exercises close to [ENEMY]'s waters. What is your opinion?
$event_text_43_a;You fully agree with the government.
$event_text_43_b;You advise to act more carefully and not provoke [ENEMY].
$event_text_43_c;The fleet needs more money and time to become ready for offensive maneuvers.
$event_text_44;[ENEMY] has sent us an ultimatum demanding financial compensation for our discovered acts of espionage. The government is interested in your opinion about this.
$event_text_44_a;Agree to their demand because our fleet is not ready to fight them. [ENEMY_MONEY]
$event_text_44_b;Refuse! Their rhetoric is unacceptable!
$event_text_44_c;Make a counter-offer. Try to negotiate on more favorable terms.
$event_text_45;[ENEMY] demands to stop naval activities near their borders as they consider them a hostile action. The Prime Minister requires your advice on how to reply.
$event_text_45_a;Agree to their demand and try to pacify them with a generous compensation because you don't want to increase the tension between our countries. [ENEMY_MONEY]
$event_text_45_b;Refuse to comply. Our fleet must be free to navigate on global waters.
$event_text_45_c;Make a counter-offer. Try to negotiate on more favorable terms. [ENEMY_MONEY]
$event_text_46;There is civil unrest in [FRIEND] that is mentioned in several newspapers. Journalists asked your opinion about this.
$event_text_46_a;[ENEMY]'s secret agents are behind this.
$event_text_46_b;You do not know anything about it.
$event_text_46_c;The increased global military awareness can cause unrest in any country. This is why we need to invest more on our Naval Fleet.
$event_text_46_d;No comments.
$event_text_47;A famous traveler from [ENEMY] has gone missing near our coastal islands. Journalists asked you to comment on the incident.
$event_text_47_a;It's terrible and I hope everything will be fine. Unfortunately we cannot do anything about it
$event_text_47_b;The fleet will allocate ships for search operations.
$event_text_47_c;In that area we lost one mine. I think he found it.
$event_text_48;During the latest sailing regatta, [FRIEND]'s Prime Minister participated with his boat but he had a small accident that caused him to fall into water. Some Journalists found the opportunity to ask you about this incident.
$event_text_48_a;Sailing is a complex and challenging sport so these things can happen. We can offer our medical facilities so that he can recover fast.
$event_text_48_b;I hope he's not hurt.
$event_text_48_c;We have sailed together in past regattas and I always remember him falling overboard.
$event_text_49;In a foreign press conference, you have been severely criticized by [ENEMY]'s Admiral of the Navy. What is your reaction?
$event_text_49_a;You find it unhonourable to talk about someone when he is not present.
$event_text_49_b;You advise him to criticize himself and his poor navy.
$event_text_5;During a naval exercise of our fleet, a small cruise ship from [ENEMY] was sunk due to accidental fire. What are your comments?
$event_text_5_a;Express your deepest apologies through diplomatic channels and provide compensation for morale and material damages. [ENEMY_MONEY]
$event_text_5_b;The exercise area was indicated in advance, so it was not our fault.
$event_text_5_c;You protest that this ship was conducting unauthorized reconnaissance of our naval forces.
$event_text_50;The press accuses you and your staff for delays and disruption of ship construction contracts. What is your answer?
$event_text_50_a;The Navy has nothing to do with the corruption caused by politicians.
$event_text_50_b;I will conduct a personal investigation and punish everyone who is responsible.
$event_text_50_c;It's a slander invented by political parties of the opposition. In fact the fleet is underfunded due to the difficult economic situation of our country.
$event_text_51;A famous traveler from [ENEMY] made a flight over our territories with a hot air balloon. What do you say about this?
$event_text_51_a;It was an act of spying and enemy reconnaissance.
$event_text_51_b;Congratulations for the achievement.
$event_text_51_c;A great example why our country needs to develop its own balloons for travelling and military purposes. [ENEMIES]
$event_text_52;In [FRIEND] there is a political turmoil. The Prime Minister asks you how to react.
$event_text_52_a;Support the anarchists.
$event_text_52_b;Aid the pacification with diplomatic means. [FRIEND_MONEY]
$event_text_52_c;Help [FRIEND] in suppressing the insurgency. [FRIEND_MONEY]
$event_text_53;The government is worried about the growing international tension. A military confrontation with [ENEMY] becomes possible. What is your advice?
$event_text_53_a;If you want peace, prepare for war! The Naval budget must be increased.
$event_text_53_b;We need to intimidate [ENEMY] by significantly enhancing our military strength.
$event_text_53_c;Negotiate with [ENEMY] and, if necessary, provide concessions. [ENEMY_MONEY]
$event_text_54;One of our ships ran aground in XX's territorial waters. What should be done?
$event_text_54_a;Apologize for the mistake but refuse the ship's inspection. Offer some financial compensation in return.
$event_text_54_b;Undermine the incident and ignore the ship which is now obsolete for us.
$event_text_55;[ENEMY]'s government proposes to mutually limit the naval budget. What is your reaction?
$event_text_55_a;You disagree, because you think they have more ships than us and want to weaken us further.
$event_text_55_b;You agree, the proposal sounds reasonable and it would help our bilateral relations.
$event_text_56;Revolutionaries in a third world country keep our ambassador hostage asking for ransom. The Prime Minister asks you what to do.
$event_text_56_a;Send a large squadron to blockade the rebel capital, until the ambassador is set free.
$event_text_56_b;Satisfy their demands.
$event_text_56_c;Clarify that you will support any decision taken by the Government.
$event_text_57;At a press conference, a journalist asked if you consider [ENEMY] as a possible enemy for the future. What is your answer?
$event_text_57_a;You consider [ENEMY] a potential adversary.
$event_text_57_b;We are ready to fight with any enemy without exceptions. [ENEMIES]
$event_text_57_c;You believe that in the near future there will be no war.
$event_text_58;The government is interested to know if you could guarantee victory over [ENEMY] in an upcoming war.
$event_text_58_a;Of course, our fleet is strong enough. It is only necessary to increase funding for the additional training of our crew.
$event_text_58_b;I can, but only after the entry into service of important combat units. Funding must be significantly increased.
$event_text_58_c;It is better to discuss how to improve the relations with [ENEMY].
$event_text_59;A political party that has won the majority in parliament wants to push through a bill to reduce the financing of the fleet. What is your reaction?
$event_text_59_a;Speak in Parliament about the potential threat of [ENEMY].
$event_text_59_c;Support their idea fully.
$event_text_6;Our government wants to organize an international regatta to promote the mutual understanding at sea between all countries. What is your opinion?
$event_text_6_a;You agree in planning events that contribute to World Peace. [FRIENDS]
$event_text_6_b;It would be a waste of money that would better be used to strengthen our fleet. [ENEMIES]
$event_text_6_c;As if the government had nothing else to do...
$event_text_60;The majority in the parliament calls for immediate action against [ENEMY]. What is your reaction?
$event_text_60_a;I completely agree! The fleet is ready for combat operations.
$event_text_60_b;It is necessary to provoke [ENEMY] into attacking us, so that the public opinion is on our side.
$event_text_60_c;The fleet is not ready for war. It is necessary to increase financing to prepare ourselves better.
$event_text_61;The Red Cross urges [WAR] and our nation to accept the exchange of prisoners. The government asks your opinion on this matter.
$event_text_61_a;You agree for an exchange.
$event_text_61_b;We do not negotiate with our enemy.
$event_text_61_c;The government is wise enough to decide what is best.
$event_text_62;Several neutral countries are pressing for a ceasefire between our country and "[ENEMY]" for a period of NN months. What is your reaction?
$event_text_62_a;We must agree in order to reorganize our forces.
$event_text_62_b;Do not agree! The enemy may take advantage of this.
$event_text_62_c;It is necessary to agree so that we can negotiate peace terms.
$event_text_63;[WAR] is accusing our country for war crimes. The Prime Minister is asking your opinion on how to react.
$event_text_63_a;The military forces of [WAR] themselves violate human rights and conduct war in prohibited ways. We offer an amount to help in the investigations and punish those actions. [FRIENDS]
$event_text_63_b;Victims among civilians are inevitable during war.
$event_text_64;XX desires to end the war with no change over previous borders. The Prime Minister asks your opinion about this proposal.
$event_text_64_a;The war has exhausted our country. This scenario would please both sides.
$event_text_64_b;Favourable war exchanges must be achieved before concluding peace.
$event_text_64_c;We should not discuss peace until they learned their lesson well!
$event_text_65;XX's government made a formal proposal to stop hostilities but their terms are far from favourable for us. The Prime Minister wants to know your opinion about this.
$event_text_65_a;Continue to fight until we take back our losses.
$event_text_65_b;Agree to end the war. The fleet does not have enough strength to keep up the fight.
$event_text_65_c;You are ready to comply with any government decision.
$event_text_66;XX is willing to recognize its defeat and pay an indemnity of $10,000,000. The Prime Minister wishes to know your opinion about this proposal.
$event_text_66_a;You agree for peace if this amount will be added to the Naval Budget.
$event_text_66_b;You advise to continue the war until we have significant territorial gains.
$event_text_67;XX is seeking to sign a peace treaty offering an indemnity of 10,000,000 and territorial concessions. What do you suggest?
$event_text_67_a;Obtain AA region and reparations of $10,000,000.
$event_text_67_b;Obtain BB region and reparations of $10,000,000.
$event_text_67_c;Trust that our government will take the correct decision.
$event_text_68;XX puts forward an ultimatum demanding from us to stop hostilities and pay an indemnity of $10,000,000. The Prime Minister asks you how we should respond.
$event_text_68_a;We have to agree, because our navy does not have enough strength to resist XX's fleet.
$event_text_68_b;Refuse to comply! Our navy will punish their unworthy demands.
$event_text_68_c;You are going to support any decision taken by the government.
$event_text_69;XX puts forward an ultimatum demanding from us to stop hostilities, pay an indemnity of $10,000,000 and give up AA region. The Prime Minister asks you how we should respond.
$event_text_69_a;It is necessary to agree. The fleet is defeated and demoralized.
$event_text_69_b;Valiantly continue the struggle against XX.
$event_text_7;In an international conference, journalists asked about your Naval Expenditures policy.
$event_text_7_a;You believe in the continuous development of a powerful military fleet as an answer to the increased naval expenditures of other countries.
$event_text_7_b;You think that our fleet is equipped with everything necessary to defend itself and is currently focusing on training the crew.
$event_text_7_c;You state that our navy is ready to fulfill its duty in respect of the agreements with other countries.
$event_text_70;Masses of dissatisfied pacifists protest and block the roads. What you propose to do?
$event_text_70_a;Use strong police forces to disperse the crowd. [FRIENDS]
$event_text_70_b;Make an official statement that the government will offer financial aid to the needy. [FRIENDS]
$event_text_71;Our intelligence suggests the financing of protest moods in XX, thereby sabotaging their ship infrastructure. This action will need additional funds from the Navy's budget. What is your reaction?
$event_text_71_a;The power of our fleet is enough and does not need that kind of help.
$event_text_71_b;Approve this funding.
$event_text_71_c;Try to find other sources of funding but keep the Navy's budget intact.
$event_text_72;After our grand victory, our women offered their wedding rings, as financial aid for the needs of the fleet. What are your comments?
$event_text_72_a;I'm impressed. These funds will help us construct new war ships.
$event_text_72_b;I propose to transfer these funds for the maintenance of hospitals and the helping of war orphans.
$event_text_73;We live in difficult times. The government is pressured to cut a significant portion of Naval Funds and allocate them to industry investments. What is your response?
$event_text_73_a;You strongly disagree! The Fleet needs those funds to be sufficiently operational!
$event_text_73_b;You find a middle solution.
$event_text_73_c;Investing in the country's economy would pay off in the long term and please the people. So you agree fully.
$event_text_74;Even though the economy is quite stagnant, the government is truly ambitious about the current naval projects and wishes to raise Naval Funds further, at the expense of social programs. Do you have any objections?
$event_text_74_a;The Navy needs as many funds as possible to become powerful! The people should understand that. [FRIENDS][ENEMIES]
$event_text_74_b;You realize that social programs must not be significantly weakened, so you accept only a portion of the Naval Funds raise.
$event_text_74_c;Even though the Navy could use those extra funds, you kindly disagree, because you don't want to hurt the people who need those social programs.
$event_text_75;One journalist asked you why the Naval Budget remains so high while people are starving in the streets?
$event_text_75_a;You clarify that the Navy's importance should not be questioned as it plays a major role in the country's defense system.
$event_text_75_b;Avoid replying directly and say that you just follow the Government's policy.
$event_text_75_c;Promise to cut a portion of the Naval Budget to fund social programs.
$event_text_76;The economic situation of our nation is in a bad state and there is danger of a growing public unrest. The government presses you to accept a major decrease in Naval Funds. What is your answer?
$event_text_76_a;Not only you don't accept this but ask for additional funds, convincing the government of the dangers we are facing versus our potential enemies.
$event_text_76_b;You agree to help the country's economy and reduce Naval Funds to a reasonable amount.
$event_text_76_c;You generously offer a large amount of the Naval Budget to be invested in heavy industry, thus aiding the economy to grow in the next months.
$event_text_77;Our economy is growing and the government asks your opinion where to allocate the extra funds.
$event_text_77_a;It is a good time to raise the Naval Funds of course!
$event_text_77_b;We could speed up the growth by reducing a little the Naval Funds. In a few months we could receive a return in profits.
$event_text_77_c;Don't change anything in the budget, since it seems to work anyway. Give the surplus to fund social programs.
$event_text_78;In a press conference, journalists ask you if the present good financial status of the country is enough to support a war versus [ENEMY].
$event_text_78_a;We are ready to defend our country against everybody who opposes us![ENEMIES]
$event_text_78_b;The Navy definitely requires more funds if a war breaks out.[ENEMIES]
$event_text_78_c;You don't see a war happening between our countries. This is why Naval Funds could be reduced in order to strengthen social programs. [ENEMIES][FRIENDS]
$event_text_79;The country's economy is blooming! There is potential to use some of the extra income to increase Naval Funds. What do you think?
$event_text_79_a;We could somewhat reduce the nation's growth to increase our Navy's strength!
$event_text_79_b;The Navy has enough funds. You don't want to risk a deterioration of the current financial status.
$event_text_79_c;We can further boost the economy by reducing Naval Funds by a small percentage!
$event_text_8;One of our military ships has collided with a Destroyer belonging to [ENEMY]. Journalists are interested in your opinion about what happened.
$event_text_8_a;You state that the accident happened because of the incompetence of [ENEMY]'s crew.
$event_text_8_b;All happened because of the bad weather conditions.
$event_text_8_c;Ignore the questions of the journalists.
$event_text_80;The government is able to provide a substantial amount to the Navy's Budget this month, but can also give this amount for social programs. Your thoughts?
$event_text_80_a;The Navy will use all this money wisely for making the fleet stronger!
$event_text_80_b;Give some money to social programs too.
$event_text_80_c;The needy people would appreciate these funds more.
$event_text_81;Naval Funds are insufficient! The government is forced to increase the Naval Budget and provide some extra money to cover your urgent expenses. This situation will not be tolerated forever!
$event_text_81_a;Understood!
$event_text_82;You served the Admiralty with honour but due to your recent mismanagement, our navy has deteriorated in all aspects. Therefore, you have been relieved from command!
$event_text_82_a;Oh no! All is lost!
$event_text_83;Interesting news sir! (NATION.CURRENT) warns their head of Admiralty: "(NAME)" for his excessive naval expenditures. He may soon be replaced if he continues to underperform!
$event_text_83_a;Indeed... interesting!
$event_text_84;(NATION.CURRENT)'s head of Admiralty leader: "(NAME)" is suddenly replaced by "(NEW_NAME)". His recent failures and overall poor management must have been the cause.
$event_text_84_a;I just got the better of him!
$event_text_85;[ENEMY] has sent us an ultimatum demanding to withdraw our fleet that is operating near their borders, claiming that it threatens their trade lines with neighbouring countries. The Government requires your advice on how to reply.
$event_text_85_a;That is an absolute disgrace! We should never accept this! If they want war, then so be it!
$event_text_85_b;It is not a good time to provoke the [ENEMY]. We have to obey and compensate for their losses... for now. [ENEMY_MONEY]
$event_text_85_c;Perhaps, if we offer [ENEMY] a generous compensation, it will soften up our relations. [ENEMY_MONEY]
$event_text_86;[FRIEND] is really admiring the power of our nation and wishes to become our ally. What is your opinion?
$event_text_86_a;Our nations will become more powerful if we work together, as allies.
$event_text_86_b;We need time to think. By becoming allies new responsibilities arise that we may not be able to handle at this time period.
$event_text_87;[ENEMY] observes so far the war but seems to slowly mobilize its forces against us.
$event_text_87_a;This is really concerning...
$event_text_88;The press in various countries is fully supporting our war efforts.
$event_text_88_a;It is good news we have friends to rely on. [FRIENDS]
$event_text_89;We have more enemies lurking for a chance to enter the war against us, as it seems the press in their countries is 100% against us.
$event_text_89_a;We must prepare for the worst case. [ENEMIES]
$event_text_9;A spy scandal has broken out! One of our spies has been arrested in [ENEMY] and the government asks for your advice on how to deal with this situation.
$event_text_9_a;Do not admit that this is our spy and hide all evidence leading to this fact by bribing those involved.
$event_text_9_b;Officially apologize for this incident with a diplomatic manner.
$event_text_9_c;Spread misinformation that it was a spy of another country ([FRIEND]).
$event_text_90;[FRIEND] is showing true interest to support us with all diplomatic means.
$event_text_90_a;They would become a very helpful ally at those difficult moments. We should build up our relations more.
$event_text_91;A serious incident has occurred which involves [ENEMY]. One of their profound politicians was assassinated in cold blood and their government accuses us that we are behind this. They ask for humiliating concessions to forget the matter. How should we respond?
$event_text_91_a;They are asking for trouble! We should never accept this accusation. Prepare for war, if that is what they want!
$event_text_91_b;A war with [ENEMY] should be avoided at this time. We can accept their demand which will also pacify our own people here, if the press becomes silent about this case. [ENEMY_MONEY]
$event_text_92;[ENEMY] has sent us a telegraph which clearly threatens us for war, accusing us for the latest warm incidents in our common borders. How should we respond?
$event_text_92_a;Our patience is over! We must reply that we will solve our problems in the war field!
$event_text_92_b;Although it is cowardice from our side, we must comply, as we cannot fight against [ENEMY] at this time period. [ENEMY_MONEY]
$event_text_93;[ENEMY] is threatening us that they will declare war on us if we do not show a sign of reducing the tension against their country. They ask from us to "invest" a portion of our naval funds on their own industry as a sign of good will.
$event_text_93_a;We should gather the press to announce that we are mobilizing our forces to prepare for a war breakout as a response to the continuous harassment of [ENEMY].
$event_text_93_b;We can give them an amount that can delay the inevitable for some time. [ENEMY_MONEY]
$event_text_93_c;Give them all that they want. We shall take it back with interest when our naval forces become ready to attack! [ENEMY_MONEY]
$event_text_94;Relations with [FRIEND] have reached a point where an alliance seems possible. Diplomats from the [FRIEND] are asking to sign a special trade agreement which will be not profitable for our nation but will strengthen further our relations. What are your thoughts?
$event_text_94_a;Investing on the relations with [FRIEND] will be a bigger reward. We should accept. [FRIEND_MONEY][FRIEND_BUDGET]
$event_text_94_b;[FRIEND] shows its true colors, trying to take advantage of our good will. No, we should never accept such terms. We are a powerful and proud nation, and we do not need such friends.
$event_text_95;[FRIEND] offers an alliance agreement but needs a considerable financial aid to support its navy. Is this something that would interest us?
$event_text_95_a;We have money to share and having an ally to fight with us in a future war would be a considerable asset. [FRIEND_MONEY][FRIEND_BUDGET]
$event_text_95_b;We understand the problems of [FRIEND] but if they do not have money to support their navy, how they can be valuable to us? We should not accept.
$event_text_96;[FRIEND] is offering a trade agreement which it turns out to be more profitable for them than for us. It is promoted as a safety measure for the future, securing our current good relations. If we refuse it will surely affect our relations negatively. Should we accept?
$event_text_96_a;We need to maintain our good relations. Sometimes diplomacy has a cost that we have to pay. [FRIEND_MONEY][FRIEND_WEALTH]
$event_text_96_b;We do not need the [FRIEND] as a friend who continuously asks favors with nothing in return.
$event_text_97;[FRIEND] is asking a significant financial aid for their short term naval expenditures which we can pay from our own funds. In return, a special trade agreement will increase our GDP in the long term. What do you think?
$event_text_97_a;Sounds like a good deal, as we have enough funds for our current needs. [FRIEND_MONEY][FRIEND_BUDGET]
$event_text_97_b;The funds allocated for our navy are sacred and should not be negotiated with anyone!
$event_text_98;An embarrasing incident involves [FRIEND]. One of their most wealthy businessmen in naval construction industry is accused for illegal activities in our country. If we prosecute this person, our relations with [FRIEND] will be affected negatively. What should we do?
$event_text_98_a;We should not interfere with justice. [FRIEND]
$event_text_98_b;Part of our naval funds will become lost due to the corrupted activities needed to clean up this mess. At least, we will not deteriorate our relations with [FRIEND].

$Help_desc_10;The *Light Cruisers* are suitable for distant commerce raiding or defense against enemy torpedo craft, while they can become especially harmful to battleships if they carry torpedo armament. Compared to Heavy Cruisers they are much lighter armored and their guns are smaller, but they are cheaper and so they can be produced in larger numbers.
$Help_desc_100;War can be triggered between two major nations when their relations reach to -100 rating. Relations are affected by events and by the tension caused by fleets. Tension is related to the power projection of ships and the value of provinces where those ships operate. A large fleet may cause no tension at all if it is situated at a sea region which covers a large and valuable province region of the nation. A small fleet may cause large tension because it was sent to operate in distant enemy waters where it should have no business to be there. Tension can lower the relations uo to -99 and only special events can drop it further to cause a war.\n\nDuring war, the enemy fleets will attempt to attack you and naval missions will be generated depending on the placement of ships on the map. Battle outcomes provide victory points that determine who is winning the war. War may end depending on various effects and the victory points for each side.\n\nWar for a long time may cause severe problems to your country's financial status. Inflation rises and the economy deteriorates. The good thing is that the Naval Budget is increased in wartime, so you may have more money to build warships, but your funds may still go in the red. Financial mismanagement or consistent battle losses will negatively impact your reputation (Naval Prestige). If your Naval Prestige reaches a value smaller than -100, then you will be fired from the Admiralty and the game is over.\n
$Help_desc_101;When a war starts then if the enemies border each other, there is a chance that the strongest nation in the military (According to the size of army, naval force and economy) chooses to initiate a major offensive. You see on the map the attack direction towards the neighboring province and each turn battles occur which may increase the advance for the attacker by a proportion. \n\nIf the attacker advances 100% towards the defender’s province, the province is immediately conquered. If the advance stalls below 25% for many turns, the defender repels the attacker and the offensive stops. If a peace treaty is signed the value of the province is reduced according to the advance of the attacker and so it can be gained as a war reparation more easily.
$Help_desc_102;You can fully control when they want to make a naval invasion against a major enemy. All they have to do is mass a large number of Naval Task Forces in the sea region and choose the action “Naval Invasion” in the Politics. In the next turn a “Naval Invasion” mission instance is created where you must place ships inside in order to support the naval invasion.\n\nThe naval invasion triggers land battles each turn if you have some ships to transfer troops. Eventually, after some turns, the invasion may end in a failure or succeed and the province becomes yours. Naval Invasion can be ordered similarly by AI opponents.\n
$Help_desc_103;During peacetime, special events can trigger missions against other smaller nations where your land armies attack automatically or you have to send a fleet to begin a naval invasion.\n\nGenerated missions indicate where you have to send ships in order to support the attack. Delaying to send ships prolongs the mission’s duration and deteriorates its success chance. Failing to send ships will affect extremely negatively the success of those missions, more often resulting in complete failure and excessive army losses.
$Help_desc_104;When unrest rises a lot for a major nation then provinces may revolt especially the distant colonies or a conquered province can be counter-attacked by the previous owner exploiting the situation. Your fleet may support the defense in special missions where you must send a fleet in the highlighted radius. Similar events happen for the non-playable nations, and these are indicated on the map in the same manner.
$Help_desc_105;Land battles generate losses for any involved side which are reducing the home population. Allied nations (Major or small) will participate in the battles depending on their distance from the battle and their naval power. As battles happen in the defender’s province, the economy of this province becomes damaged accordingly. The Logistics factor greatly affects the efficiency of the armies and is dependent on the transport capacity and naval power of the nation. When a nation loses its naval power, then its land armies become significantly weaker.
$Help_desc_106;Oil resources boost the economy of the nation that has them in various ways and also affect the fuel dependency of the fleets. If a nation has not a direct access to oil resources then ships with oil fuel are significantly more expensive to maintain and the fuel takes longer to replenish. On the contrary, nations with oil resources that are at a high level depending on the population needs, will notice a significant boost in fuel replenishment rate and the ability of their fleets to operate in distant waters becomes increased.\n\nOil discovery events notify where oil is found and on the map there is a special icon which highlights the oil production provinces. Barren provinces of the middle east will become very rich and important when oil becomes discovered in their soil.
$Help_desc_107;When you visit this section you see a list of available ship designs. Click on *“New design”* to be transferred to the Ship Design section (See: “Ship Design” above) and create a new design.\n\n*View:* You see the ship design in the 3D shipyard. From there, you can refit the design and upgrade ships that belong to this design.\n*Delete:* Deletes an obsolete design. This option is not available if there are still active ships based on this design.\n*Build ship:* A small window appears with options on how many ships to build from the selected design.
$Help_desc_108;The port capacity of the home provinces affects the size of domestic shipyards and their capability to support the construction of warships. The larger the home port capacity the larger is the shipbuilding capacity of a nation. When the shipbuilding capacity becomes exceeded due to simultaneous building of many ships, then the construction rate decreases resulting in severe production delays and increased construction costs. \n\nIn that case, it is advised to at least suspend the construction of some ships to speed up the building of the rest of the warships.\n
$Help_desc_109;You can access the *Refit mode*, when you enter the “View” mode of a ship in the “Ship Design” list and select the “Refit” button.\n\nIn the *Refit Mode* you can modify existing designs with certain limitations. You cannot adjust the base Displacement (although the weight can change if you alter the Beam/Draught or other elements of the ship) and new parts can be placed only in positions close to previous parts of the same type.\n\nThe *Refit Mode* can be just a quick upgrade of some components or a complete overhaul of the ship, using new weapons and unique towers. \n\nWhen you save the Design, it is automatically named according to the name of the original Design and the current year. Finally you can build your selected Refit Design by pressing the *“Refit Ship”* button and selecting which ships to upgrade. The final cost and time is dependent on the amount of work needed to complete the refit.\n\n
$Help_desc_110;In this section you see, on a list, all the ships belonging in your fleet and what is their current action. Three buttons appear below according to your selection:\n\n*View:* You see the selected ship in the 3D shipyard.\n*Suspend:* It appears when a ship is under construction and halts its building. This option is very useful to control your expenses when your budget is low on funds.\n*Scrap:* Permanently destroy the ship. A small portion of its value is converted to naval funds.\n\nAdditionally, you can select the following actions for your ships:\n[=] *Role:* The “In Being'' role commands the selected ship to operate near its port. The “Sea Control '' maximizes its battle engage radius, so it can participate in more distant missions across the globe, according to its operational range. The "Limited" role is available only during peacetime and reduces the ship maintenance at the expense of a much reduced training progress for your crew.\n[=] *Mothball / Add Crew:* When you mothball a ship, its crew is removed and its maintenance becomes very low in cost. The ship is not available for action while in “Mothball” status. You can add the crew back to the ship to make it fully operational, if there is enough in the crew pool.\n[=] *Select port:* It appears when a ship is under construction. With this button you can select where the ship is going to be launched when completed.\n
$Help_desc_111;As you pass turns in the campaign, missions may become available for your fleet. \n\nSome missions may be ignored but if they include friendly transport ships, you will lose them, negatively affecting your Victory Points status.\n\nKey missions will need your immediate attention. These missions cannot be avoided and you need to take one of the following actions, where applicable:\n[=] *Fight*: Go to Battle or Auto-resolve \n[=] *Delay*: Attempt to hold a safe distance from the enemy fleet but do not engage. This action may fail if the average speed of your fleet is much smaller than the enemy’s. If it succeeds then there can be an escalation on the next turn, inviting more ships for both sides into the location.\n [=] *Withdraw*: Attempt to escape. This action may fail if the average speed of your fleet is much smaller than the enemy’s.
$Help_desc_112;Moving a group of ships anywhere on the map, automatically assigns a Task Force at the destination point. The fleet assigned at this position has a certain “Denial Zone” according to the sum of ship power projection. The bigger the radius of the “Denial Zone” the larger the distance it controls, preventing enemy fleets from passing unchallenged.\n\nShips assigned in a Task Force are useful to guard narrow sea passages or move nearer to enemy waters and generate offensive missions with all the assigned ships in participation. Be aware that the enemy task forces will counter your movements and may trap your fleet into unfavorable situations.\n\nCreating Task Forces should be something carefully planned, as the ships cost more while they are at sea, but if they are successful they can create a very important strategic advantage.\n\nTask forces have special roles Invasion/Protect which currently affect the raiding of enemy transports or the protection of your own convoys. Choosing to "Invade" increases the offensive behavior against enemy transports but also reduces the defenses against raiding of your own transports. The "Protect" works the other way around. \n\nNote: Later the "Invade/Protect" options will also affect the missions that are generated favoring an overall more offensive or defensive behavior of the ships.
$Help_desc_113;The submarines are special sea vessels which cannot be designed and fully controlled in battle as ships. In order to gain access to submarines it is needed to execute experiments via technology research.\n\nAfter the last experiment is successful, new submarine hulls can be researched and become available for building, and more research allows to improve their capabilities which are the following:\n\n*Attack:* Determines the damage that can be inflicted to enemies.\n*Stealth:* Determines the chance of becoming detected by enemies while attacking. If the submarine is not detected, then it delivers hits without receiving any damage. If it becomes detected then stealth helps it to escape and lessens the chance of receiving damage.\n*Hull Strength:* The main factor that protects the submarine from receiving critical damage after being detected.\n*Speed:* Determines not only the speed that the submarine travels on map (how many turns it needs to reach a point) but also contributes significantly to all its combat actions. For example, a slow submarine will escape unharmed with much smaller chance, or a fast submarine has less chances to become detected provided that it has a high stealth rating.\n*Range:* Submarines can only travel at a distance depended from the nearest port and the submarine's range. For example, a coastal submarine with small range, will only be able to travel and create missions at short distances around its port or move to another nearby port. A larger cruiser submarine will have a much less restricted operational radius. The range also determines the attack radius of the submarine group. Submarines attack only enemies included in this relatively small attack radius.\n\nThe submarines cannot operate in the same group with warships and are restricted in the amount of vessels that can enter a submarine group. Similarly to Task Forces, submarines that are near an enemy fleet will generate missions which can be avoided or auto-resolved.
$Help_desc_114;*ASW* (Anti-Submarine Warfare) rating reflects the ability of the ship to trace and destroy submarines. This value is mainly affected by technologies that allow the detection of submarines and is further dependent from the spotting capability and speed of the ship. \n\nAttacking and destroying submarines is accomplished by various means, mainly by "Depth Charges" which are the strongest weapons against them. Only destroyers and cruisers can be equipped with Depth Charges.\n\nShips without ASW are virtually defenseless against a submarine attack.\n\n*Important:* Only the respective technology category "ASW" allows a minimum level of ASW rating for ships. Without this technology research, the ships have zero ASW and are completely defenseless against submarines, as they cannot detect them to damage them.
$Help_desc_115;The *Recon* rating represents the reconnaissance capability of the ship, its ability to report enemy movements without being detected, and greatly improves the strategic power of the fleet to gain initiative on offensive missions or get away from trouble before the enemy comes too close.\n\n“Recon” is affected mainly by the respective technology as well as spotting, detectability and speed attributes of the ship.\n\nLarge and slow ships such as battleships are expected to have a smaller “Recon” rating than small cruisers and destroyers. Radio and Radar equipment greatly increase the reconnaissance capability surpassing inherited disadvantages of larger ships.
$Help_desc_116;Each ship has a “power projection” rating according to its type, displacement and operational range. During war, when a nation becomes overwhelmingly more powerful in regards to “power projection”  in sea regions that cover the biggest part of their home provinces then it can blockade its enemy. The blockaded nation suffers from economic stagnation while more transports become sunk from the enemy per month. The only way to break the blockade is to destroy the “power projection” advantage of the enemy, either by sinking enemy ships or building more ships and becoming more powerful.
$Help_desc_117;Ships that are in Task Forces can be set to "Invade" or "Protect". While in "Invade" they contribute more in sinking enemy transports in each campaign turn, while in "Protect" they increase the defense of transports that operate in their area. \nVarious technologies increase their impact accordingly.
$Help_desc_118;When war starts, destroyers (DD) or light cruisers (CL) which are in ports and have mine equipment will start generating minefields. Mines are deployed in each campaign turn and increase the minefield radius around ports according to the current level of related technology and the mine capacity of the minelayers. \n\nWhen enemy ships enter the minefield then there is a chance to be hit. This chance is affected by the various technologies related to minefield countermeasures. Friendly ships can be hit too but with a much lower chance.\n\nWhen war ends, then the minefields will automatically start to be cleaned up.\n\nMinefields are strategically important for protecting ports, as enemy fleets need to approach ports in order to create “Port Strike” missions, and so in this occasion the involved fleets may have surprisingly high losses due to mine hits  if they have a low minesweeping capability (See: “Minesweeping).
$Help_desc_119;Only minelaying submarines have the ability to generate minefields in areas far away from their own ports. The minelaying submarines can create minefields anywhere on the map which can be cleaned up according to the minesweeping capability of enemy fleets. These special minefields follow the minelayer submarines as they move on the map in a radius around them.\n(See: “Minesweeping).
$Help_desc_120;All Task Forces (ship groups at sea) have a minimum minesweeping capability determined by technologies and the size of the fleet, simulating smaller escort ships which act as minesweepers. If a Task Force's minesweeping radius intersects with an enemy minefield then it will automatically start cleaning it up according to its average minesweeping capacity.\n\nTorpedo Boats and Destroyers can be equipped with "Mine Hunter Kits" which convert them to very effective minesweepers, significantly boosting the minesweeping capacity of the Task Force they belong to.\n\nMinesweepers are not only useful for cleaning up minefields, but also aid in lessening the chance of the escorted ships to become hit while they are inside a minefield. 
$Help_desc_121;The operational range of a ship directly affects its fuel consumption. When ships are sent to operate at sea, then in each turn they spend fuel according to their movement, their control zone and the battles they fight. Ships that have lower than 10% fuel enter a "Low Fuel" state which restricts their cruising speed while they move on the map and their maximum speed when in combat, while their maintenance cost is increased.\n\nShips gradually replenish their fuel according to their distance from the nearest port and the free capacity of the port. If the port's capacity has been exceeded, it is expected to notice a very slow fuel replenishment, which can greatly diminish the combat effectiveness of the ships. The cost of the replenished fuel is measured according to the base cost of the designed ship's operational range.\n\n*Note:* Fuel is limited in “Custom” and “Naval Academy” battles. The initial fuel for each ship is depended on its operational range and the special setting of the battle. Therefore, it is critical to design ships with at least “Medium” operational range to avoid “Low Fuel” problems.
$Help_desc_122;When ships fight at sea they spend ammunition. This ammunition is gradually replenished according to the distance of ships from the nearest port and the free capacity of the port. If the port's capacity becomes full, then it is expected to notice a very slow ammo replenishment of the ships, something that can render them almost useless against the enemy. \nThe cost of the ammo replenishment depends on the weapons’ base cost of ammunition as it was designed for each ship.
$Help_desc_124;You quickly prepare a battle (without the design process) by selecting the nation, technology year, ship types for each side, as well as the initial distance between the fleets. Then you press the button *"Quick Start"* to start the battle.
$Help_desc_125;After setting up the custom battle conditions, you can press the button *"Design Ship"*. You are then transferred to the shipyard to design your favorite ship type (According to the available ships of your fleet). The rest of the ships will be auto-designed.
$Help_desc_126;If you enable the special setting *"Unlock"* your own fleet will use any hull type of any nation for the selected year. You will be able to explore all those hulls if you enter the *"Design Ship"* interface.
$Help_desc_15;The ship design interface is divided into two main sections. On one side you find the -currently available- tunable parameters *“Characteristics”* and *“Armor”*. On the other side you see a statistical summary of all the effects applied on the ship. On the lower section, you find all the ship assets that you can mount on the ship: Towers, Guns, Funnels, Torpedo Launchers etc.\n\nThe steps to gradually design your ships are:\n1. *Set the displacement:* Each hull type has a minimum and maximum displacement. You will notice that the ship becomes much more expensive as its size increases.\n2. *Set the speed:* Adjusting the ship’s maximum speed determines the required engine machinery and has a respective cost in money and weight.\n3. *Set range:* Operational range is affecting the ship’s participation in campaign battle generation, so it has no effect in Naval Academy (it will be fixed later). It simulates the amount of fuel and supplies carried by the ship.\n4. *Set Bulkheads:* The more subdivisions of the hull, the more enhanced the underwater protection and overall damage control of the ship.\n5. *Select assets and mount:* In most ship types, you need at least one main tower, one secondary tower, one funnel and one or two main guns as minimums. You will discover what is the best combination for each ship as you see their effect in weight and ship performance.\n\nFor a quicker process, you can use the button *“Auto-Design”* and then make minor adjustments to the preferred design that it is automatically generated. The *“Clear”* button deletes every object you mounted on the ship, and is useful for a quick wipe out of wrong input. Useful explanations are found in tooltips for every functional design aspect, as you hover your mouse on a parameter or statistic. The *“Save Design”*  or *“Launch”* button finalizes your design, unless there are invalid design choices so the respective warnings appear. You will not be able to finalize the design unless you correct these mistakes.\n
$Help_desc_16;The *Displacement* is the ship’s weight and is expressed in tons of water that its hull displaces.\n\nThe displacement affects how many tons of machinery, armor, armament and other important equipment can be fitted. The more tonnage, the larger and more powerful the ship at the expense of becoming less maneuverable and bigger target.\n\nThe maximum displacement of a hull cannot be exceeded during the design process so this is why you need to carefully utilize the available free space. Be aware that the final build may have flaws and make the ship overweight or lighter than expected.\n\n+ Allows more equipment\n+ Allows more armor\n+ Allows more powerful armament\n+ Increases ship’s structural durability during combat\n- Increases ship’s cost\n- Requires more engine power to achieve high speeds\n- Decreases maneuverability\n- Makes ship a larger target
$Help_desc_17;*Speed* measured in Knots determines how fast the ship can travel on sea and is one of the most important tactical factors in naval warfare. \n\nFast warships can outmaneuver slower enemies or evade and withdraw when needed.\n\nSlow warships will not be able to keep safe distance from torpedo equipped enemies and will be unable to chase weaker targets in order to destroy them.\n\n+ Increases maneuverability\n+ Helps in evading combat and stronger enemies\n+ Helps in chasing weaker enemies\n+ Makes the ship harder to target\n- Engine’s machinery increases ship’s cost\n- Decreases available tonnage
$Help_desc_18;The Operational *Range* measures how far can the ship travel away from friendly ports without refueling and is determined by the ship’s fuel storage.\n\nAs technology develops, the engines’ fuel consumption becomes more efficient, so less ship’s tonnage is needed for fuel tanks. Faster travelling speed allows quicker journeys and reduces the tons reserved for food supplies.\n\nThe minimum operational range limits the ship to coastal defense and standard naval duties while higher range gives the capability to participate in distant naval raids, surprise strikes and special missions, making it a much more useful and multi-purpose warship. \n\n+ Increases operational usefulness\n+ Increases probability of convoy raids\n+ Increases probability of favourable naval missions\n+ Decreases maintenance penalty in distant travels \n- Fuel storage and consumption increases ship’s cost\n- Decreases available tonnage
$Help_desc_19;\n*Bulkheads* are reinforced walls that divide the hull’s interior in multiple rooms.\n \nThe amount of bulkheads directly affects the ship’s survivability. When the hull is subdivided in many sections, flooding or fire damage are more easily controlled, while the ship’s citadel is far more protected against shells that penetrate the hull. \n \nThe citadel encloses the machinery and magazine spaces, thus engine damage and ammo detonation become less likely when bulkheads’ division is dense and well armored.\n \n+ Improves overall flooding protection \n+ Improves overall fire protection in sections below the waterline \n+ Reduces probability of engine damage from penetrating shells \n+ Reduces probability of ammo detonation from penetrating shells\n- Increases ship’s cost \n- Decreases available tonnage
$Help_desc_20;*Beam* represents the width of the hull. A wider hull is a more stable shooting platform and has an increased displacement and resistance but is generally slower, less maneuverable, a larger target and requires significantly more engine horsepower to achieve a reasonable speed.\n\n*Draught* or Draft mainly determines the height of the hull. In other words it is the vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of the hull (keel). A taller and consequently a larger hull is a less stable shooting platform but is more resistant against flooding and can carry more load, while the operational range becomes increased by its ability to maintain the cruising speed with less wave resistance.
$Help_desc_21;You can design the following ship types: Battleship, Battlecruiser, Heavy Cruiser, Light Cruiser, Destroyer and Torpedo Boat. For each ship type, newer hulls become available as technology develops. Each hull has four basic characteristics which give to the hull unique base statistics. These are: *Resistance*, *Hull Form*, *Stability* and *Floatability*.\n\nThe *Resistance* of the hull affects the damage received from shell hits and torpedoes, after armor penetration. Additionally, it applies special slope design that increases the ricochet chances of incoming shells.\n\n*Hull Form* affects the ship's acceleration, turning speed and the engine power needed to achieve top speed. Additionally, it affects the speed penalty from structural damage. Hull Form effects can be modified by ship design.\n\nThe higher the *Stability* of the hull, the more accurate are the guns on high speed and bad weather. Stability is further affected by ship design.\n\n*Floatability* affects the impact of flooding on the hull. The higher this number, the less probable to get flooding after a hit and the less slow down due to flooding. Floatability effects may deteriorate by ship design.
$Help_desc_22;Each object you mount on a ship, increases its size signature, making it more *detectable and a bigger target*. The *Surface Visibility* is the minimum distance from which a ship becomes visible if observed from sea level. Spotting boost received from the highest operational tower allows to trace ships beyond this range. If towers become destroyed, enemy ships can only be spotted according to their surface visibility.
$Help_desc_23;The *Main Tower* is an integral part of the ship and must exist in all designs. Towers enhance visibility, accuracy and damage control. Smoke from funnels may obstruct visibility and reduce their effects.\n\nThe *Secondary Τower* is needed in most ship types and is an additional supportive element of the main tower. Usually, the secondary towers suffer more from funnel smoke obstruction, unless they are tall enough.
$Help_desc_24;At least one *Funnel* is needed for the proper operation of the ship engine. More funnels improve steam efficiency and thus boost the engine and boiler performance, meaning more speed and acceleration power.\n\nThe *Funnel capacity* is a statistic depended from the funnels and expresses the maximum engine horsepower that the boiler system can support. If the engine is not adequately supported, then steam efficiency is reduced and penalties apply to ship speed and acceleration.\n\n*Funnels emit smoke* that obstructs visibility and reduces gun accuracy. High towers reduce this negative effect. Rear towers usually suffer more from smoke obstruction, unless they are tall enough.
$Help_desc_25;The longitudinal instability is caused by the weight distribution in the longitudinal axis of the ship. Increased instability on that axis increases pitch motion of the hull and affects gun accuracy, ship maneuverability and may make the ship more prone to flooding. \n\nThe transverse instability is expressed by the weight distribution in the lateral axis of the ship. Increased instability on that axis results in an increased roll motion of the hull and affects gun accuracy, ship maneuverability and may make the ship more prone to flooding. \n\nDesigns with yellow or red warnings will generally have bad seakeeping but maybe this can be compensated by the added firepower of heavy weapons or other useful equipment.\n\n*Increasing weight on center stabilizes the ship* and reduces the Pitch and Roll effects. A very effective way to accomplish this, is to increase the engine machinery by adjusting the speed slider.
$Help_desc_30;The *big guns* (9-inch and higher) cause tremendous damage according to their caliber. So it is usually a good practice to maximize the caliber of the ship’s main guns, if the technology allows it.\n\n*Small guns* (2-inch up to 8-inch) are no match against big guns but should not be underestimated. Their high fire rate can quickly disable a ship if it stays in their range for long and they are very effective against torpedo boats.\n\nShips with a *uniform main gun battery* aim faster, because their salvo shots create water splashes that are more easily observed if they do not conflict with splashes of other gun types. Therefore, an “all big gun” ship with many guns of the same caliber is capable of acquiring a target faster than a ship of mixed gun caliber.\n
$Help_desc_31;According to ship type the allowed caliber for main guns is the following:\n\nBattleships & Battlecruisers: 9 to 20-inch\nHeavy Cruisers: 6 to 11-inch\nLight Cruisers: 4 to 7-inch\nDestroyers: 2 to 5-inch\nTorpedo Boats: 2 to 4-inch
$Help_desc_32;Secondary guns are smaller in caliber than main guns and are either turreted or in casemates. According to ship type, these are the allowed calibers:\n\nBattleships & Battlecruisers: 2 to 8-inch\nHeavy Cruisers: 2 to 5-inch\nLight Cruisers: 2 to 3-inch\nDestroyers: None\nTorpedo Boats: None\n
$Help_desc_35;*Gun technology* improves the gun accuracy, reload, range and penetration, so it required  careful examination whether to use bigger guns of older technology or smaller guns of more advanced technology.
$Help_desc_36;The *gun muzzle velocity* is the initial speed of the shell at the moment of firing but is not fully indicative on how fast it can travel to the target. The shell maintains its speed and striking velocity according to its weight. So, the bigger the shell, the slower it decelerates due to air drag and the flatter its striking angle.\n\nCompared to small guns, the bigger and more advanced guns are able to fire bigger shells at a velocity that is providing greater range and striking power. This firepower cannot be underestimated when you design warships.
$Help_desc_37;The bigger the guns mounted on a ship, the larger the weight of their ammo storage. \n\nWhen mounting big guns on a ship that is not sufficiently protected with armor and damage control technologies, it is like playing with fire. The size of guns and their respective ammo makes your ships prone to *detonation* if shells penetrate the hull near the magazine section.
$Help_desc_38;*Armor piercing shells (AP)* are usually the preferred choice against heavily armored targets. \n\nIf the guns are too weak against strong armor, or the distance of target is too large, then *High explosive shells (HE)* may prove more effective as they will detonate on the surface of the deck and may at least cause fire instead of negligible damage.
$Help_desc_40;The *Underwater torpedo launchers* are placed below the waterline and are found in large capital ships. They have reduced fire arc and less tubes compared to deck torpedo launchers but they are preferable in capital ships, because they are safer to use.
$Help_desc_44;*Belt armor* covers the warship from the sides, starting from the main deck down to some distance below the waterline. The belt armor prevents shells or torpedoes from penetrating horizontally to the heart of the hull and cause catastrophic internal damage.\n\n*Belt extended* armor is the extension of the belt armor on the bow and stern of the ship. It does not have to be as thick as the belt because projectiles that strike from the front or rear are more easily deflected due to the angle of impact.
$Help_desc_45;*Deck armor* covers the warship’s deck surface and protects against long-range plunging fire that can cause devastating damage to the ship’s citadel.\n\n*Deck extended* armor expands the deck armor on the bow and stern, making the ship better protected against plunging fire received from the front or rear.
$Help_desc_46;If the ship has armor, the main belt and main deck enclose a special area which is called "Citadel". A citadel protection scheme with multiple inner layers can be enabled for extra protection. The multiple armor layers reduce the penetration power of an incoming shell so that its chance to penetrate the last layer and cause internal damage is much lessened.\n\nThis armor system saves significant weight in comparison to a solid thick armor plate which has thickness equal to the sum of all layers, while it offers almost the same protection.
$Help_desc_49;*Turret armor* shields the main guns against horizontal shell hits, usually inflicted from short and medium distance. Turret armor is typically very strong in battleships because their main guns are their most important weaponry.\n\n*Turret top armor* protects the main guns against plunging shell hits that are regularly inflicted from long range fire. Shells that penetrate the turrets from above may cause a catastrophic explosion of their ammo storage.\n\nThe casemate guns can also be protected with armor, to be protected from the sides and top.

$Help_desc_53;Select one of your ships and hover your cursor on an enemy to view the estimated hit chance, which is determined by various factors.\n\nHovering your cursor on enemy ships allows you also to watch their main statistics and their targeting against your ships, but this extra information may delay to appear, depending on enemy ship size and distance from your forces.
$Help_desc_54;Guns slowly improve their aiming by firing *bracketing salvos* with a methodical procedure. Firing successive double shots in front and behind of the target, gradually determine the target’s range and bearing. When the target becomes acquired then the guns start firing rapidly with their maximum fire rate.\n\nThe *target acquiring* of the guns is dependent on multiple factors. The ship tower and gun technology speeds up the gun aiming, while the distance, speed and maneuvering of the target may slow down or even completely reset the targeting procedure.\n\nWhile the ship guns have a *target acquired* there is an additional accuracy bonus that is received over time.\n
$Help_desc_55;*Swift maneuvers* may severely slow down your ship’s targeting procedure, but can also deteriorate the aiming of your enemies against your ship.\n\nIf you want to maximize your targeting efficiency, you should keep a steady course with your ship and, ideally, maintain a *cruising speed*.
$Help_desc_57;Firing at full broadside usually maximizes your firepower against the enemy, but also makes your ship more vulnerable to enemy shells. Shell penetration power is depended on the *angle of hit*, so shells that hit from the side have more chances in penetrating and maximum chance when they hit perpendicularly.\n\nThe *shell ballistics* affect greatly their penetration power. Firing from long range reduces the side penetration power but the vertical angle increases the chance of penetrating from the top. The so-called “plunging hits” can be devastating if the targeted ship has insufficient deck or turret-top armor.\n\nAn effective practice to *lessen the chance of shell penetration* is to advance towards the enemy facing with the bow of the ship. This way incoming shells have reduced penetration power due to the smaller angle of hit or they may ricochet and become completely ineffective
$Help_desc_58;The maximum damage of a shell hit occurs when there is a *penetration* of the hull. In that case the shell explodes inside the ship and can be devastating depending on its explosive charge and the penetrated section of the ship.\n\nThe *partial-penetration* inflicts small damage to the hull, as the shell fails to pierce the armor completely and explodes in its surface. Even in this case, there is still a chance of fire ignition after such a hit, depending on the surface of the ship that became damaged.\n\n*Over-penetration* happens when the kinetic energy of the shell is too high against a lightly armored surface, so it passes from one side of the ship to the other, before it's fuze explosion. Shells that over-penetrate still cause significant damage to the ship as they tear up its hull and can create flooding or destroy weapons and other compartments, while the shell detonation may cause fire if it happens near the ship.\n\nWhen the ship armor is very strong it can *block* shells that hit its surface. The deflected shells may still explode and ignite fire on the above-water sections of the ship. \n\n
$Help_desc_59;The ship that inflicts the first hits usually gains significant advantage, depending on the inflicted damage. The damaged ship may suffer from temporary or permanent slowing down, making it an easy target, while penalties apply to its accuracy due to the instability caused to the hull that dissipates over time.\n\nThe damage of ships is delivered to their multiple sections and their weapons. Green indicator means the damage is insignificant/light. Yellow indicator means the damage is medium/heavy. Red damage indicator means the complete destruction of the section or weapon.
$Help_desc_62;*Fire* causes slight structural damage on the section it has ignited until it is extinguished. Fires can be ignited by shell or torpedo hits and may spread out to adjacent sections if not put down quickly.\n\nSections that are *completely destroyed* will not receive further damage from fire, but this fire may spread to adjacent sections.\n\nA ship may sink from "Extensive Fire" if the fire spreads to most sections of the ship and can no longer be controlled.
$Help_desc_63;*Flooding* is caused by torpedo hits or shells that penetrate underwater sections. Flooding damage may spread to multiple sections and will only stop depending on the ship’s damage control and bulkhead system.\n\nSections that are already *fully flooded* do not receive anymore flooding damage from a torpedo hit. However, flooding may spread to adjacent sections.
$Help_desc_64;The green bar indicator shows the *structure integrity* of the ship. Ship damage reduces structure integrity and slows down the ship.\n\nThe blue bar indicator shows the *flooding status* of the ship. Damage to underwater sections causes flooding and slows down the ship, as well.\n\nWhen structure integrity or flooding status become zero, then the ship sinks.\n
$Help_desc_65;Each ship has a crew complement according to its hull and various parts. The “Quarters” slider in the ship design interface, determines the maximum amount of crew that can be added to the ship, with three available thresholds: *“Cramped”, “Standard”, “Spacious”*.\n\nThe crew services four main battle stations: *Control, Main Guns, Secondary Guns, Torpedoes*. The minimum crew needed for each station must be maintained in order for the ship to operate at its full efficiency. \n\nDuring battle, the ship may start to have crew losses and if a Station begins to have less crew than it minimally needs, penalties start to apply in various aspects of the ship.\n\n[=] *Control* Station uses crew from Main Tower, Secondary Tower, Funnels and affects: Damage Control, Aiming.\n[=] *Main Guns* Station uses crew from Main Guns and their respective barbettes and affects: Main Guns Reload, Main Guns Long Range Accuracy.\n[=] *Sec Guns* Station uses crew from Secondary Guns and their respective barbettes and affects: Secondary Guns Reload, Secondary Guns Long Range Accuracy.\n[=] *Torpedoes* Station uses crew from torpedo launchers and affects: Torpedo Reload, Torpedo Accuracy.
$Help_desc_66;The Crew training skills span from 0 to 100 maximum rating and are categorized in six thresholds: *Cadets, Green, Trained, Regular, Seasoned, Veterans*. \n\nIn the campaign, the crew can be trained up to “Trained” level. The crew can level up further only if it gains experience in combat.\n\nIn the *Naval Academy* and *Custom Battles* the Crew training can be chosen in the ship design phase at a significant cost that depends on the ship’s cost and equipment. \n\nThe training skills increase as training becomes higher and are the following:\n\n[=] *Accuracy:* increases the base accuracy of guns and torpedoes.\n[=] *Aiming:* affects gun ladder aiming and all the procedures needed to find the range and target enemy ships.This skill is uniquely enhanced by the crew training, adding to the aiming bonuses of ship equipment and greatly improves the gun accuracy during a battle.\n[=] *Reload Time:* lessens the time needed to reload guns and torpedoes.\n[=] *Damage Control:* speeds up fire extinguishment, water pumping, and module repairs.\n\nA well trained crew significantly enhances the efficiency of warships, but cannot replace the importance of advanced naval technology. Therefore, when you design ships in Naval Academy and Custom Battles, it is needed to carefully examine the benefits of having numerous and highly trained crew over buying more expensive gear or building more ships.
$Help_desc_68;Your fleet is made up of individual ship formations called “divisions”. A division may include up to 5 ships. On the bottom of the screen you view the active divisions for you and the enemy.\n*UPDATE*: From Alpha-9 update the division can receive more than 5 ships.

$Help_desc_9;Cruisers are ships that fulfill various naval roles depending on their armor and weaponry. Compared to Light Cruisers, the *Heavy Cruisers* have stronger armor and larger guns, so they are potentially more powerful at the cost of being more expensive and less maneuverable.
$Help_desc_90;When you select to play the campaign, you are transferred to a window where you must choose which nation to play. At the moment, the starting year does not contain changes in borders and economy but determines the technology progress, so you can test more advanced ships faster.\n\nThere are two options for your initial fleet:\n\n[=] *Use generated fleet:* Your starting fleet is automatically designed and built.\n[=] *Create your starting fleet:* The design and building of your starting fleet is made by yourself.
$Help_desc_91;By default you see the global map, divided in sea regions and on the right a summary of important info. Clicking on sea regions shows the contained fleet strength of every nation. There is a minimum tonnage required to control those waters depending on enemy fleets, connected provinces’ financial power and peace/war status. At the moment there is no effect, but later, various penalties will be issued, resulting in revolts and financial deficiencies.\n\n*Moving ships:* \n\n==1st Method==\n[=] Select a sea region that contains one of your fleets with left click\n[=]  Select “Move Ships”, then possible path appears as you move your cursor\n[=]  With right click select your destination.\n[=]  A window appears where you can select the moving ships either one by one from a list, or by dragging the strength bar.\n[=] Finalize your move order by left clicking on the button “”Move”.\n\n==2nd Method==\n[=] Directly select a fleet with left click.With right click select the destination and continue as above.\n\n*Cancel Move:* \n[=] Select a sea region that contains one moving fleet with left click\n[=] Click on the button “Cancel Moving”, on the appearing window.\n\n*Next Turn Button:*\nYou progress on the next turn by pressing the respective button. Events may pop up at the start of next turn. 
$Help_desc_92;In this window you see the economy's status of your nation and the corresponding naval budget which you use each turn to spend on ship building, maintenance, technologies etc. \n\nYour monthly funds are dependent from the annual revenue of the government (GDP) as part of the  yearly naval budget percentage.\n\nAt the moment, the following actions  are functional:\n\n\n*Crew Training:* The amount of money spent for training and recruiting new crew. The Training Pool receives new cadets which are gradually trained according to the funds spent. Crew in the pool and ships can reach the maximum level of “Trained” with training. Only in battle the crew of the ships can receive higher training skills.\n\n*Transport Capacity:* Your nation’s economy and fleet need transport ships in order to function at full potential. This slider determines the policy cost of building more transports. If you have "Transport Capacity" higher than 100% your GDP receives bonuses. During war you will start having an economic impact with each loss of transport, if the "Transport Capacity" is lower than 100%, so investing in "Transport Capacity" will keep your economy strong in the long term. Be aware that the cost of maintaining a large transport fleet is analogous to your nation’s economy and provinces.\n\n*Tech Budget:* Allocating more funds in the Tech Budget speeds up the technology research accordingly. By reducing the budget to zero, the research speed is literally put to a hold. \n\n*Shipyard Size:* The maximum displacement of ships that you can construct in your shipyard facilities. You can enlarge the Shipyard Size by pressing the button *Build*. When the construction is finished, the new increased size becomes available. If funds are becoming low during the construction, you can cancel but you will receive a much smaller part of the planned shipyard size for the amount being spent.\n\nThe following information is also shared in this window:\n\n[=] *Government type:* No effect yet.\n[=] *Unrest:* People become discontent according to events and war outcomes. If Unrest becomes 100 then a revolution happens and a change of government. You may be able to remain at your position if your naval prestige is high enough.\n[=] *Naval Prestige:* Is affected by your naval funds management and battle results. It if becomes minimum (-100) then you become fired and the game ends for you\n[=] *Fleet:* All the ships under your command.\n[=] *Submarines:* No effect yet.\n[=] *Naval Technology:* Your technology level compared to other nations.\n[=] *Provinces:* How many provinces are controlled by your nation. Province interaction is now minimally working.\n[=] *Government Budget & Naval Budget Expenses:* Many effects are currently disabled. Here you see various data that shows your nation’s financial data. If the country is at war, inflation is expected to rise, gradually making the government’s economy weaker and negatively affecting the naval budget which is a percentage of annual income.
$Help_desc_93;In this window you oversee the naval technology of your nation. The technology progresses in all categories in a pace affected by various random events. You can speed it up in two ways: Increasing the technology budget or allocating up to three priorities. When you allocate a priority to a technology category it becomes researched faster but all other non-prioritized categories progress slower.
$Help_desc_94;In this window it is shown useful information about the following:\n\n*GENERAL*\n*Government:* The government type of the nation. If you hover on the government a tooltip appears with the respective modifiers (See: Governments).\n*Nation’s People:* The people’s support for the government. The support is reduced according to the unrest level. If unrest increases then the chance to have a rebellion in conquered provinces increases. If it reaches 100 then a national revolution occurs which violently changes the government and the Chief Admiral may become replaced if he has naval prestige lower than zero.\n*Naval Prestige:* If Naval prestige reaches the value of -100 then the Chief Admiral of the nation becomes replaced. \n*Provinces:* The number of provinces owned by the nation.\n*Technology:* Compares the level of naval technology with the other nations. *Average* means that the technology is about the same level with most other nations. *Advanced* means that technology is better and *Behind* the opposite.\n*Home State Population*: The population of the nation's home provinces. This population contributes to the army and navy needs for manpower.\n*Other Population:* The population of conquered provinces and colonies. \n*Army Force:* The current active land army for the nation. When tension increases the army mobilization increases accordingly reaching its peak during a major war. The army’s costs burden the GDP and thus negatively affect the available funds for the Navy.\n*Army Logistics:* The army logistics is a factor affecting the supply of your army and is depended heavily on the fleet’s ability to protect the supply routes. If the transport capacity and navy’s power are reduced then the army will become dysfunctional and will not be effective in land combat.\n\nAdditionally, army logistics are dependent on the number of controlled provinces and their population. A nation which is overextended, possessing many colonies and conquered territories, will need a considerably large navy to keep army logistics at a high level.\n\n*FINANCIAL*\n*GDP:* The estimated Gross Domestic Product of the nation.\n*Growth:* The estimated annual and monthly growth of the GDP.\n*Oil Production per Capita:* The estimated oil production divided by the total population of the nation. The bigger this number the more benefit in logistics and supply needs of the army and navy. Ships running with oil fuel are the most benefited but also the most penalized when there is oil shortage.\n*Yearly Army Budget:* The estimated yearly costs of the land army.\n*Yearly Naval Budget:* The estimated yearly funds allocated for the navy.\n*Crew Pool:* The current reserve crew that can be sent to fill up the ships.\n\n*NAVAL*\n*Active Fleet:* The ships available for service.\n*Building:* How many ships are under construction.\n*Repairing:* How many ships are under repair.\n*Refit:* How many ships are under refit.\n*Task Forces:* How many ship groups are at sea..\n*Navy’s Power Rating:* An estimator of the navy’s power depended on various factors.\n*Navy’s Total Tonnage:* The fleet’s total tonnage.\n\n*RELATIONS*\nIn this panel we see the relations between all the playable major nations. When nations are allied, their relations are +100 and when at war it is -100.\n\n*MINOR ALLIES*\nSome smaller nations that are economically and diplomatically more powerful than others, can form alliances with major nations that provide financial bonuses as well as army and navy support for the major nations. In return, these smaller nations are protected and if another major nation threatens them it can ignite a major war. (See: Minor Allies).\n\n*ACTIONS*\nThe Diplomatic actions available to use for other major nations (See: Diplomatic Actions).\n
$Help_desc_95;The base governments are *Absolute Monarchy*, *Constitutional Monarchy* and *Democracy*. Constitutional Monarchy and Democracy have a parliament, elections and five different parties: *Nationalists, Right Wing, Center, Left Wing, Communists*.\n\nAccording to the government that rules the nation, different modifiers apply affecting the GDP growth, province income, naval funds, land army power and unrest.  The flags of the Major Nations change depending on their governments, for example, when Nationalists win the elections in Germany, the Nazi flag is used. \n\nConstitutional Monarchy is a special type of government which filters out the effects of the different parties that win the election every 4 years. Both types of Monarchy are abolished when there is a revolution and democracy becomes established.
$Help_desc_96;You can interact with other major nations by using five different options: *Improve Relations, Increase Tension, Cancel Alliance, Peace Treaty, Naval Invasion*. Each option becomes available according to the situation. \n\n“Improve Relations” and “Increase Tension”  appear  for a nation that is not at war with you. \n\n“Cancel Alliance” may appear when the nation is allied for more than a year and the alliance is not involved in a war. \n\n“Peace Treaty” appears when during war a peace treaty event triggers but negotiations fail. \n\nThe “Naval Invasion” appears when you place a fleet of more than 100,000 tons in a sea region of an enemy major nation..\n\nAll those options except “Naval Invasion” have a chance to succeed as you do not take the decision  but try to influence the government for the respective action and the AI can also use them against you or other nations.
$Help_desc_97;When the relations between two nations reach the +100 rating then they become allies. Positive relations can be achieved by events or by reduced tension. Tension lowers if you assign the "Limited" role to your ships or generally reduce the activity of your ships in sea regions of other nations. Positive relations can reach the maximum rating of +99 and only special events can increase it further to form an alliance. \n\nWhen you form an alliance you automatically declare war to enemies of this alliance.
$Help_desc_98;Smaller nations with enough economic and diplomatic power may sign a special alliance agreement with a major nation which positively affects the economy of the major nation, allows the trade of warships and activates military aid in both land and sea for both sides.
$Help_desc_99;The major nation can sell warships to allied smaller nations upon their requests. When you accept a sales order then the requested ships are automatically added to the building queue with a payment in advance and the rest of the profit is received when they are completed. \n\nIf necessary, the building of the sold ships can be stopped, but this may negatively affect relations with a small state, which may lead to the collapse of the alliance. The sold ships are added to the fleet of the small nation and during war they can aid their allies in their vicinity. For example, you or the AI can sell ships to Greece and Greece’s ships will participate in naval battles for her allies.\n\nAdditionally, when you mothball ships, you may receive special sale orders for them for a discounted price. It would be more profitable to sell those ships than to scrap them.

Tōgō was proclaimed "the Nelson of the East" by western journalists for his achievement to decisively defeat the Russian fleet in the Russo-Japanese War.
$LoadingScreens_Text_104;*Franz Ritter von Hipper* (September 13, 1863 - May 25, 1932) was an Admiral of the German Navy, famous for commanding the German battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group during World War I. Hipper led the German battlecruisers on several raids of the English coast. At the Battle of Jutland, he succeeded in sinking three British battlecruisers before his flagship “Lützow” was sunk.
$LoadingScreens_Text_105;*SMS Cap Trafalgar* was a German passenger liner converted to an auxiliary cruiser at the outbreak of World War I. Soon after the war it was sunk in the South Atlantic by another auxiliary cruiser named RMS Carmania, making it the first armed merchant cruiser destroyed by a ship of the same class.
$LoadingScreens_Text_106;*The Battle of Yalu River* occurred on 17 September, 1894 and it was the biggest naval engagement of the First Sino-Japanese War. The Chinese fleet was bigger but it had aged ammunition and poorly trained crew. The Japanese fleet had much faster and technologically advanced ships, so it decisively won sinking many Chinese ships.
$LoadingScreens_Text_107;*Operation Albion* (October 12 - 20, 1917) was a German Land and Naval battle to seize the West Estonian archipelago from the Russian Empire. It was the last major battle for the Russian Imperial Army in the First World War versus the Central Powers and a major defeat with more than 20,000 soldiers captured and a battleship sunk.
$LoadingScreens_Text_108;*The Battle of Manila Bay* took place on May 1, 1898, during the Spanish - American War between the American Asiatic Squadron under Commodore “George Dewey” and the Spanish Pacific Squadron of Rear admiral “Patricio Montojo”. The outcome was the complete destruction of the Spanish fleet which marked the end of the Spanish colonial period in Philippine history.
$LoadingScreens_Text_109;*The Battle of Dogger Bank* (January 24, 1915) was a naval battle of the First World War between the raiding fleet of Admiral Franz Hipper and the British intercepting fleet of David Beatty. The Germans lost the armored cruiser “Blücher” and most of its crew so the British claimed victory although their Battlecruiser “Lion” was severely damaged and out of action for many months.
$LoadingScreens_Text_11;*Hover your mouse over an enemy ship* to check its main statistics and targeting against your ships. This information may delay to appear, depending on the ship’s size and distance from your forces.
$LoadingScreens_Text_110;*SMS Magdeburg* was a modern German Light Cruiser of World War I that participated in many naval bombardments against Russian positions until it ran aground on 26 August 1914 near the Estonian coast. The Russians seized the ship and recovered three intact German code books which helped to decrypt German wireless signals during the war.
$LoadingScreens_Text_111;*The Second Boer War* (October 11, 1899 - May 31, 1902) was fought between the British Empire and two Boer states, the “Republic of Transvaal” and the “Orange Free State” over the control of South Africa’s rich diamond mines. At first the Boers had many successes using guerrilla tactics, but eventually they were suppressed by the overwhelming military power of the British Empire.
$LoadingScreens_Text_112;*The Amur-class minelayers* were the first ocean-going minelayers in the world. The class consisted of two vessels: Amur and Yenisei constructed for the Imperial Russian Navy in the late 1890s. During the Russo-Japanese War Yenisei struck one of her own mines and sank while Amur's minefields sank the Japanese pre-dreadnought battleships Hatsuse and Yashima. Eventually Amur was sunk by Japanese howitzers in December 1904.
$LoadingScreens_Text_113;*The Siege of Port Arthur* (August 1, 1904 - January 2, 1905), was the longest and most fierce land battle of the Russo-Japanese War involving a considerable number of battleships. The Siege of Port Arthur saw the introduction of arms technology used in subsequent wars of the 20th century and cost the lives of more than 100,000 soldiers for both sides. Port Arthur was eventually captured by the Japanese.
$LoadingScreens_Text_114;*The Battle of Coronel* (November 1, 1914) was a World War I naval engagement, near the coast of central Chile. The East Asia Squadron of the Imperial German Navy led by Vice-Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee defeated the British West Indies Squadron commanded by Rear-Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock, sinking 2 armored cruisers and killing 1,570 crew without any losses for the German fleet.
$LoadingScreens_Text_115;*The Battle of Santiago de Cuba* (July 3, 1898) was a naval battle of the Spanish-American War with an almost bloodless victory for the American fleet. The USA lost only one soldier and ten were wounded while the Spanish losses were incomparably higher and their fleet was completely destroyed.
$LoadingScreens_Text_116;*Alfred von Tirpitz* (March 19, 1849 - March 6, 1930) was a German Grand Admiral who held the position of Secretary of State of the German Imperial Naval Office, between 1897 - 1916. As the supervisor of naval design and technology of the German Empire, Tirpitz took a modest Imperial Navy and transformed it to the 2nd Naval Power of the world.
$LoadingScreens_Text_117;*John Fisher* (January 25, 1841 - July 10, 1920), held the position of First Sea Lord of the British Navy and was the influential person behind many naval technology advances. He was responsible for the construction of HMS Dreadnought, the first all-big-gun battleship, as well as other naval developments that aided Great Britain to compete with the increasing naval threat of the German Empire.
$LoadingScreens_Text_118;*The Battle of the Falkland Islands* (December 8, 1914) was a naval action between the British Royal Navy and Imperial German Navy during the First World War. After the defeat at the Battle of Coronel, the British sent a large force to track down and destroy the victorious German cruiser squadron. All German ships except the auxiliary cruiser “Seydlitz” were hunted down and sunk.
$LoadingScreens_Text_119;*Hugh Evan-Thomas* (October 27, 1862 - August 30 1928) was a British Admiral who commanded the 5th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet during World War I and fought at the Battle of Jutland with his flagship, the Battleship HMS Barham which was moderately damaged. Among the injured was his dog “Jack” who followed him on the ship.
$LoadingScreens_Text_12;The green bar indicator shows the *structure integrity* of the ship. Ship damage reduces structure integrity and slows down the ship. When structure integrity becomes zero, then the ship sinks.
$LoadingScreens_Text_120;*The Battle of Tsushima* (27 - 28 May 1905) marked the culmination of the Russo-Japanese War and demonstrated that fast battleships with big guns could completely dominate the seas. In this battle the Russians suffered a crushing defeat and the utter destruction of their fleet, while the Japanese lost only three torpedo boats.
$LoadingScreens_Text_121;*SMS Emden* was a German Light Cruiser that became famous for its raiding operations in the Indian Ocean during World War I. From August 1 to November 9, 1914, seized 23 merchant ships, sank Russian cruiser “Pearl” and a French destroyer, until it was sunk by the Australian cruiser HMAS “Sydney”.
$LoadingScreens_Text_122;*The Battle of Jutland* (31 May - 1 June 1916) was the largest naval battle and the only full-scale engagement between battleships in World War I. The German fleet of Reinhard Scheer inflicted much more damage to the stronger British fleet of John Jellicoe. However, the German fleet was forced to retreat and as it could not afford more battleship losses, it avoided combat and lost the naval superiority of the North Sea for the remainder of the war.
$LoadingScreens_Text_123;*Varyag* was a protected cruiser of the Russian Imperial Navy that was severely damaged and captured by the Japanese at the Battle of Chemulpo Bay in the Russo-Japanese War (9 February 1904). The Japanese named it “Soya” and sold it back to the Russians after 12 years when they became allies during World War I.
$LoadingScreens_Text_124;*USS Olympia* was a protected cruiser that saw service in the United States Navy. This vessel became famous as the flagship of Commodore George Dewey at the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War in 1898 and is the oldest steel American warship still afloat.
$LoadingScreens_Text_125;*Mikasa* was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). Named after Mount Mikasa in Nara, Japan, the ship served as the flagship of Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō throughout the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 - 1905, participating at the blockade of port Arthur and the Battles of the Yellow Sea and Tsushima.
$LoadingScreens_Text_126;*Petropavlovsk* was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the Imperial Russian Navy that served as the flagship of Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov during the Russo-Japanese War. On March 31, 1904, the battleship was blown up by a Japanese mine near Port Arthur and sank, causing the death of 679 men, including Stepan Makarov.
$LoadingScreens_Text_127;*Knyaz Suvorov* was a Borodino-class pre-dreadnought battleship of the Imperial Russian Navy that became the flagship of Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky. During the Russo-Japanese war it was sunk on May 14, 1905 at the battle of Tsushima taking down the whole crew except the admiral and a few officers who were saved by a Destroyer.
$LoadingScreens_Text_128;*HMS Dreadnought* was a battleship of the Royal Navy that came into service in 1906 and revolutionized the naval power of that era. Dreadnought’s creation is credited to Sir John "Jacky" Fisher, First Sea Lord of the Board of Admiralty and signified such an advance in naval technology that its name defined an entire generation of battleships, the "Dreadnoughts".
$LoadingScreens_Text_129;*Derfflinger* was a class of three battlecruisers of the Imperial German Navy that were considered among the finest of the First World War, due to their balanced armor and armament. One of the ships of this class -SMS Lützow- became the flagship of Franz von Hipper.
$LoadingScreens_Text_13;The blue bar indicator shows the *flooding status* of the ship. Damage to underwater sections causes flooding and slows down the ship. When flooding status becomes zero, then the ship sinks.
$LoadingScreens_Text_130;The *Invincible* class was the world’s first battlecruiser and it was a design conceived by Admiral Sir John ("Jacky") Fisher, also the father of the world's first "all-big-gun" warship, HMS Dreadnought. The Battlecruiser’s operational role was to defeat smaller cruisers but not stand on the main line against heavier battleships.
$LoadingScreens_Text_131;*HMS Iron Duke* was a dreadnought battleship of the Royal Navy, the lead ship of her class, named in honour of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Iron Duke served as the flagship of the Grand Fleet during the First World War and its biggest naval engagement was the Battle of Jutland.
$LoadingScreens_Text_132;The *Chinese ironclad “Dingyuan”* was the flagship of the Chinese Beiyang Fleet. She and her sister ship “Zhenyuan” participated in the Sino-Japanese War but could not compete with the more advanced and faster Japanese warships.
$LoadingScreens_Text_133;The *Nassau* class was the German response to the introduction of the "all big gun" British HMS Dreadnought. The class consisted four ships: Nassau, Rheinland, Posen, and Westfalen, all laid down in mid-1907, and completed in 1910.
$LoadingScreens_Text_134;The *Tegetthoff* class was the sole class of dreadnought battleships built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The ships of this class were among the first to utilize superimposed triple gun turrets for their main armament.
$LoadingScreens_Text_135;The *armored cruiser Asama* was the lead ship of her class and was built in British shipyards for the Imperial Japanese Navy. She served in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 during which she participated in the Battle of Chemulpo Bay, the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of Tsushima.
$LoadingScreens_Text_136;The *Bayern* class of German battleships were built during World War I and were the first armed with 380-mm guns (about 15-inch), as well as the last and most powerful of the war.
$LoadingScreens_Text_137;The *Braunschweig-class battleships* were pre-dreadnought battleships of the German Imperial Navy and included five ships: Braunschweig, Elsass, Hessen, Preussen, and Lothringen. The ships were an improvement over the preceding Wittelsbach class, having a larger main battery and better armor protection.
$LoadingScreens_Text_138;*HMS Audacious* was the fourth and last King George V-class dreadnought battleship. She displaced 25,420 tons and carried five twin 13.5-inch main guns. She served the Royal Navy for about one year until she sank by a German mine in October 1914.
$LoadingScreens_Text_139;*HMS Hood* was the last battlecruiser of the Royal Navy. Despite not possessing the flaws of previous battlecruisers which had weak magazine protection resulting in their explosion at the Battle of Jutland, she was eventually sunk because of the same reason by the German Battleship “Bismarck” on 24 May 1941.
$LoadingScreens_Text_14;Firing at full broadside usually maximizes your firepower against the enemy, but also makes your ship more vulnerable to enemy shells. Shell penetration power is depended on the *angle of hit*, so shells that hit from the side have more chances in penetrating and maximum chance when they hit perpendicularly.
$LoadingScreens_Text_140;The battleship *Sevastopol* was the first ship of the Gangut-class battleships of the Imperial Russian Navy, laid down in 1909. The Ganguts were the first Russian dreadnoughts designed to have lighter armor than the typical standards but hosted powerful 4x triple 12-inch guns and reached about 24 kn top speed.
$LoadingScreens_Text_141;The *España battleship* was the only dreadnought class built for the Spanish Navy. She had two sister ships, “Alfonso XIII” and “Jaime I”. Compared to other battleships of her time she had very small displacement (15,700 t), however she had a sufficient main battery of 4x twin 12.0-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_142;The *South Carolina* battleship was the first dreadnought of the US Navy, built in 1910. She followed most of the foreign standards, consisting of very strong armor and 4x twin 12-inch guns. Her small displacement of 16,000 tons did not allow to carry a strong engine, limiting her top speed to only 18.5 kn and ultimately restricting her operational role.
$LoadingScreens_Text_143;*Dante Alighieri* was the first dreadnought of the Royal Italian Navy, and was completed in 1913. The ship served as a flagship during World War I, but her imposing 4x triple 12-inch guns were never utilized since the ship saw very little action other than the 2nd Battle of Durazzo in 1918 where she did not engage enemy forces.
$LoadingScreens_Text_144;The *Kawachi* class is considered the first dreadnought of the Japanese Navy, built in 1912. Kawachi and her sister ship “Settsu” participated in the Battle of Tsingtao but saw no other combat in World War I. Their 12-inch 6x twin main guns in hexagonal layout were not uniform in barrel length, making them less effective in long range aiming.
$LoadingScreens_Text_145;*Miklós Horthy* (June 18, 1868 - February 9, 1957) served in the Austro-Hungarian Navy and became a Vice-Admiral at the end of World War I.

Among them was the passenger liner “RMS Lusitania” which caused the loss of 1,198 people and played a major role in convincing the USA to participate in the war. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_149;One of the most famous acts of Germany’s unrestricted submarine warfare occurred on May 7, 1915 when U-boat U-20 torpedoed and sank the British passenger liner *RMS Lusitania*. Among the 1,198 victims were 128 American citizens, a fact that eventually brought the United States into the war on the British side.
$LoadingScreens_Text_15;An effective practice to *lessen the chance of shell penetration* is to advance towards an enemy facing with the bow of the ship. This way incoming shells have reduced penetration power due to the smaller angle of hit or they may ricochet and become completely ineffective.
$LoadingScreens_Text_150;*Horatio Herbert Kitchener* (June 24, 1850 - June 5, 1916) was a senior British Army officer, mostly known for his harsh measures against the Boers and his influential recruitment policy at the start of World War I. He foresaw that the war will last for many years and pressed for a massive recruitment campaign that was proven very effective.
$LoadingScreens_Text_151;*Lord Kitchener Wants You* was a 1914 recruitment poster of World War depicting Lord Kitchener calling the viewer to enlist in the British Army against The Central Powers. It is considered one of the most influential images of World War I that inspired soldiers from all the world to fight against Germany and her allies.
$LoadingScreens_Text_152;*Uncle Sam* (initials U.S.) is a common personification of the American government or the United States. The famous 1917 poster was based on the original British Lord Kitchener poster of three years earlier and was used to recruit soldiers for both World War I and World War II. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_153;*HMS Hampshire* was one of the six Devonshire-class armored cruisers that Lord Kitchener used for a diplomatic trip to Russia during World War I. As she was sailing alone, on 5 June 1916, she struck a German mine and sank, taking down 737 crew and Kitchener himself.

$LoadingScreens_Text_159;The *U-35* was a German submarine that belonged to the U 31-class U-boat and operated in the Mediterranean Sea during World War I. It was the most effective U-boat of the war, sinking 224 ships of total 539,741 tons. Her longest serving captain was Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière, the most successful submarine commander in history.
$LoadingScreens_Text_16;The *shell ballistics* affect greatly their penetration power. Firing from long range reduces the side penetration power but the vertical angle increases the chance of penetrating from the top. The so-called “plunging hits” can be devastating if the targeted ship has insufficient deck or turret-top armor.
$LoadingScreens_Text_160;*Paolo Thaon di Revel* (June 10, 1859 - March 24, 1948) was an honorable admiral of the Italian Navy who served in multiple positions during his career before he became a politician.

$LoadingScreens_Text_169;At the *Battle of Ulsan* on 14 August 1904 the Russian Squadron of Karl Jessen was utterly defeated by a Japanese squadron led by Kamimura Hikonojō. The Russian cruisers “Rossia” and “Gromoboi” were severely damaged and “Rurik” was sunk while the Japanese had minimal losses.
$LoadingScreens_Text_17;*Armor piercing shells (AP)* are usually the preferred choice against heavily Armored targets. If the guns are too weak against strong Armor, or the distance of target is too large, then *High explosive shells (HE)* may prove more effective as they will detonate on the surface of the deck and may at least cause fire instead of negligible damage.
$LoadingScreens_Text_170;*Deutschland* was one of seven submarines designed to carry up to 750 tons of cargo between the United States and Germany, through the naval blockade of the Entente Powers. When the United States entered the war against Germany the class was converted into long-range cruiser U-boats and began sinking allied ships.
$LoadingScreens_Text_171;The *E-class submarine* was the mainstay of the British submarine fleet during World War I. In total, 58 submarines of this class have been produced and served the Royal Navy till World War II.

$LoadingScreens_Text_175;The *Washington Naval Conference* (12 November 1921 to 6 February 1922) was the first international conference held in the United States and the first arms control conference. The agreed Washington Naval Treaty aided world peace by limiting the tonnage displacement of war ships constructed by major powers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_176;The *Washington Naval Treaty* signed on 6 February 1922, was an agreement among the major nations that had won World War I to prevent an arms race by limiting naval construction. It allowed the limited construction of battleships, battlecruisers and aircraft carriers while other categories of warships were restricted to 10,000 tons displacement.
$LoadingScreens_Text_177;*SMS Goeben* was the second of two Moltke-class battlecruisers of the Imperial German Navy, launched in 1911. After the outbreak of World War I, the two ships were transferred to the Ottoman Empire on 16 August 1914, and Goeben became the flagship of the Ottoman Navy as “Yavuz Sultan Selim”. The “Yavuz” was decommissioned in 1950 making it the longest-serving dreadnought-type ship in any navy. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_178;The *Battle of Imbros* occurred on 20 January, 1918 when the Ottoman battlecruiser “Yavûz Sultân Selîm” and light cruiser “Midilli” attacked the British monitors and destroyers near the island of Imbros in the Aegean Sea. Although the Ottoman forces accomplished their objective to destroy the monitors, they struck a minefield while withdrawing, causing the severe damage of Yavûz and the sinking of Midilli. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_179;Although experimental submarines were used from the 18th century, the extensive use of the *submarine* began during World War I, when it became technologically possible to fire torpedoes while submerged. The submarine’s military value was recognized in this war, as over 5,000 allied ships were sunk by U-Boats.
$LoadingScreens_Text_18;*High explosive shells (HE)* are generally more effective against lightly armored ships, since they can still penetrate and cause increased damage due to their higher load of explosives.
$LoadingScreens_Text_180;*HMS Ark Royal* was the first ship in history designed and built as an aircraft carrier. In the First World War, Ark Royal participated with her aircrafts conducting aerial reconnaissance in the Gallipoli Campaign and the Macedonian Front. In January 1918, several of her aircraft unsuccessfully attacked the Ottoman battlecruiser “Yavuz”. Since then she was used in training missions till the Second World War.
$LoadingScreens_Text_181;*HMS Argus* is considered the first example of a standard aircraft carrier, with a full-length flight deck that allowed wheeled aircraft to take off and land. She was converted from an ocean liner during the First World War and served in the Royal Navy from 1918 to 1944.
$LoadingScreens_Text_182;*Eugene Burton Ely* (21 October, 1886 - 19 October, 1911) was an American pilot, who executed the first shipboard aircraft take-off and landing on January 18, 1911. Eight Months later he died in an exhibition flight. For his contribution he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross , on February 16, 1933.
$LoadingScreens_Text_183;*Minesweepers* are usually very small and lightly armed vessels but their role to detect and clear minefields is indispensable for any fleet. During World War I, even fishing trawlers were converted to Minesweepers to counter the increasing use of naval mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_184;A *Minelayer* is a special type of ship that is used to deploy naval mines and can be highly effective. A good example was the Ottoman Minelayer “Nusret” whose minefield sank HMS Irresistible, HMS Ocean, and the French battleship Bouvet in the Dardanelles on 18 March 1915.

$LoadingScreens_Text_187;Before the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894-1895, the Chinese imperial fleet known as *Beiyang Fleet*, was the largest fleet in Asia and the 8th in the world in terms of tonnage. After its destruction from the Japanese Fleet, the Chinese Navy lost all chances to become a naval superpower.
$LoadingScreens_Text_188;*The Gallipoli Campaign* (17 February, 1915 - 9 January, 1916) was a large-scale military operation executed by the Triple Entente forces versus the Ottomans in an attempt to seize the Dardanelles Straits and open the sea route in the Mediterranean for the Russian Empire.
$LoadingScreens_Text_189;The failure of the Triple Entente forces in the *Gallipoli Campaign* and their horrific losses were the reason that *Winston Churchill* resigned from his high position in the Admiralty, as one of the main supporters of this operation.
$LoadingScreens_Text_19;The maximum damage of a shell hit occurs when there is a *penetration* of the hull. In that case the shell explodes inside the ship and can be devastating depending on its explosive charge and the penetrated section of the ship.
$LoadingScreens_Text_190;During the *Gallipoli Campaign*, on 18 March 1915, the Allied fleet attempted to seize the straits with their naval force of 18 battleships and an array of cruisers and destroyers. The German heavy artillery that was used by the Ottoman army prevented the minesweepers from clearing the minefields which later caused the sinking of many allied ships.
$LoadingScreens_Text_191;In the *Gallipoli Campaign* the allied fleet did not risk their most advanced ships and sent mostly older, pre-dreadnought battleships supported by over 100 other smaller craft. The battleship losses by torpedoes and mines were quite heavy for the Royal Fleet, including HMS Goliath, HMS Irresistible, HMS Majestic, HMS Ocean, HMS Triumph, while the French Fleet lost Bouvet and Massena.
$LoadingScreens_Text_192;Although the Ottoman losses in the *Gallipoli Campaign* were heavy, the failure of the Allied forces to win their objectives and their withdrawal marked a needed victory for the Ottoman Empire which was in a state of collapse.
$LoadingScreens_Text_193;The French pre-dreadnought battleship *Suffren* was laid down in 1904 and had displacement of 12,432 tons and two twin 12-inch guns. She was damaged in the Gallipoli Campaign but did not survive the torpedo attack of the German submarine U-52 that took her down with the entire crew on 26 November, 1916.
$LoadingScreens_Text_194;*HMS Nelson* and her sister ship *HMS Rodney* were two battleships built under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. To reduce the weight of armor, all the 16-inch main gun turrets were mounted forward to shorten the armored citadel.

After the war she served in the Yugoslavian and Croatian Navy and was renamed “Sava”. Today it is under restoration to become a floating museum.
$LoadingScreens_Text_20;The *partial-penetration* inflicts small damage to the hull, as the shell fails to pierce the armor completely and explodes in its surface. Even in this case, there is still a chance of fire ignition after such a hit, depending on the surface of the ship that became damaged.
$LoadingScreens_Text_200;*Aurora* is a Pallada Class Cruiser launched in 1900. She survived the Battle of Tsushima and participated in both World Wars.

$LoadingScreens_Text_205;The *Borodino-class* or Izmail class was a group of four battlecruisers ordered by the Imperial Russian Navy before World War I, laid down in late 1912. These ships of 33,000 tons and 14-inch main battery were never completed due to industry shortages during the war and the Russian Revolution of 1917 which eventually halted all work.
$LoadingScreens_Text_206;The *Lexington-class* was a group of six battlecruisers ordered by the United States Navy in 1911 as a reaction to Japan's Kongō class. Due to technology limitations and war needs there were multiple redesigns that delayed the program. Four of the ships were eventually canceled and scrapped and the rest (Lexington and Saratoga) were converted into the United States' first fleet carriers, in compliance with the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922.
$LoadingScreens_Text_207;The *Amagi-class* was a series of four battlecruisers planned for the Imperial Japanese Navy. The ships were to be named Amagi, Akagi, Atago, and Takao and would reach 47,000 tons in displacement and 30 knots speed. Due to the limitations of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty and an earthquake that destroyed the hull of Amagi only Akagi survived from the project which was reconstructed as an aircraft carrier and served in the Second World War.
$LoadingScreens_Text_208;The *Tosa-class* battleships were two super dreadnoughts ordered for the Imperial Japanese Navy and were launched in late 1921. They would be equipped with five twin 16-inch guns but due to the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty they could not be completed.

$LoadingScreens_Text_209;The *Kongō-class* was a class of four battlecruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy during 1911-15. The lead ship of the class, Kongō, was designed by British naval architect George Thurston and was the last Japanese capital ship constructed outside Japan by Vickers. Her sister ships Haruna, Kirishima and Hiei were fully made in Japan.
$LoadingScreens_Text_21;*Over-penetration* happens when the kinetic energy of the shell is too high against a lightly armored surface, so it passes from one side of the ship to the other, before it's fuze explosion. Shells that over-penetrate still cause significant damage to the ship as they tear up its hull and can create flooding or destroy weapons and other compartments, while the shell detonation may cause fire if it happens near the ship.
$LoadingScreens_Text_210;*Yuzuru Hiraga* (8 March, 1878 - 13 February, 1943) was a career naval officer in the Imperial Japanese Navy and a leading naval architect in the 1910s and 1920s, who designed a number of famous warships, many of which would later see action during World War II.

$LoadingScreens_Text_243;*HMS Neptune* was a dreadnought battleship of the Royal Navy that was laid down in 1909 and completed in 1911. She was the first British battleship with a superimposed turret which was placed aft. Displacing almost 20,000 tons, she had a powerful battery of five twin 12-inch guns, multiple secondary guns and three submerged torpedo tubes.  Her steam turbine engines allowed her to reach the speed of 21 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_244;The *Orion-class battleships* were a group of four dreadnought battleships built in the early 1910s and the first 13.5-inch-gunned (343 mm) for the Royal Navy. Reaching the displacement of 22,000 tons and speed of 21 knots they were among the most powerful battleships of their time.
$LoadingScreens_Text_245;The *King George V-class* was a group of four dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy between 1911-1913. It was an enlarged version of the preceding Orion class presenting additional armor, improved secondary armament and an enhanced fire-control system. Those ships were termed super dreadnoughts due to their capabilities having 25,830 tons displacement, five twin 13.5 inch guns and 21 Knots speed.
$LoadingScreens_Text_246;The *Iron Duke class* was a group of four super dreadnought battleships built for the British Royal Navy during 1912-1914. The class comprised four ships: Iron Duke, Marlborough, Benbow, and Emperor of India which were an improvement of the preceding King George V- battleships, featuring the same ten 13.5 inch guns, but had stronger armor and larger 6-inch secondary guns, instead of the 4-inch mounted on the earlier ships.
$LoadingScreens_Text_247;The *Queen Elizabeth-class battleships* was a series of five super-dreadnoughts that were commissioned in 1914–16 and served the Royal Navy in World War I and World War II.

$LoadingScreens_Text_248;The *Queen Elizabeth-class battleships* were five super-dreadnoughts of the British Royal Navy that were commissioned in 1914–16. At their time, they were considered superior in firepower, protection and speed, featuring four twin 15-inch guns, maximum armor of 13 inches and speed of 24 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_249;The *Nelson-class battleships* were represented by HMS Nelson and HMS Rodney that served the British Royal Navy in 1927–1947. In order to retain maximum firepower and armor under the terms of Washington Naval Treaty they carried all nine 16-inch (406 mm) guns forward of the bridge to shorten the armored citadel.
$LoadingScreens_Text_25;*Flooding* is caused by torpedo hits or shells that penetrate underwater sections. Flooding damage may spread to multiple sections and will only stop depending on the ship’s damage control and bulkhead system.
$LoadingScreens_Text_250;The *King George V-class battleships* had the same class name with the older British Dreadnoughts built in 1911 and were the most modern British battleships in commission during World War II. Five ships of this class were built during 1940–1942 which were HMS King George V, HMS Prince of Wales, HMS Duke of York, HMS Howe and HMS Anson.
$LoadingScreens_Text_251;*HMS Vanguard* was the biggest and fastest battleship ever built for the Royal Navy. She was commissioned in 1941 and completed in 1946, after World War II. The design of this ship had been affected by the urgent necessities of the war, thus she was not equipped with new triple 16-inch guns but four twin 15-inch guns that were in storage. HMS Vanguard had a maximum displacement of 52,250 tons at deep load and a top speed of 30 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_252;*HMS Invincible* was the lead ship of her class of three battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy between 1906–1909 (The other ships were named HMS Inflexible and HMS Indomitable). In the Battle of Falkland Islands, she displayed her potential versus smaller cruisers but her armor weakness was exploited during the Battle of Jutland where she was destroyed by a magazine explosion after one of her gun turret's armor was penetrated.
$LoadingScreens_Text_253;The second class of British Battlecruisers, succeeding the Invincible-class was the *Indefatigable-class*. Indefatigable, New Zealand and Australia were built during 1909-1913 and had a maximum displacement of 22,490 tons. Their main armament was four twin 12-inch guns and they reached the speed of 25.8 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_254;The *Lion-class* succeeded the Indefatigable-class of British Battlecruisers and were a significant improvement over their predecessors in terms of speed, armament and armor. “Lion” and “Princess Royal” reached the high speed of 27.5 knots, displaced over 31,300 tons, carried four twin 13.5-inch guns and featured up to 9-inch armor.
$LoadingScreens_Text_255;*HMS Queen Mary* was the last battlecruiser built by the Royal Navy before World War I. The sole member of her class, Queen Mary featured eight 13.5-inch (343 mm) guns mounted in four twin turrets and her maximum speed was 28 knots. She was sunk in the Battle of Jutland by the German battlecruiser Derfflinger which hit her twice causing a magazine explosion.
$LoadingScreens_Text_256;*HMS Tiger* was a battlecruiser of the Royal Navy that was completed at the start of First World War and was the most heavily armored battlecruiser of the Royal Navy at that time. Constructed during 1912–1914 she displaced nearly 33,800 tons and had four twin 13.5-inch guns as main armament. Her most major engagement was in the Battle of Jutland where she was only lightly damaged despite suffering many hits by German shells.
$LoadingScreens_Text_257;The *Renown-class of battlecruisers* of the British Royal Navy were the world's largest and fastest capital ships upon completion in 1916, reaching 37,400 tons of displacement and 32 knots speed. The class consisted of HMS Renown and HMS Repulse carried large 15-inch guns mounted in three twin turrets.
$LoadingScreens_Text_258;The *Courageous-class* was a group of three battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy during World War I in 1915–1917. They were otherwise known as "large light cruisers" since their displacement of 22,922 tons was significantly smaller than other battlecruisers. Though smaller, they carried powerful 15-inch guns mounted in two twin turrets and their geared steam turbines offered the high speed of 32 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_259;The *Admiral-class* was designed near the end of World War I and was planned to include four battlecruisers for the British Royal Navy but eventually only HMS Hood was completed. Built during 1916-1920, HMS Hood was an advanced ship that became the flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet, displacing 46,200 tons and carrying four twin turrets of 15-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_26;Sections that are already *fully flooded* do not receive anymore flooding damage from a torpedo hit. However, flooding may spread to adjacent sections.
$LoadingScreens_Text_260;The *Orlando-class* was a group of seven armored cruisers built for the Royal Navy between 1888 and 1889. They had displacement of 5,600 tons, achieved 18 knots speed and their armament consisted of two 9.2-inch guns, multiple other smaller guns and six 18-inch torpedo tubes mounted underwater and on deck.
$LoadingScreens_Text_261;The *Edgar-class* was a series of nine protected cruisers built around 1891 for the Royal Navy. All of those ships participated in the First World War and only one of them was lost during the war (HMS Hawke). Their displacement was 7,890 tons and two 9.2-inch guns supported their main armament.
$LoadingScreens_Text_262;The *Powerful-class* was a group of two protected cruisers built during 1894–1898 for the Royal Navy. Powerful, and Terrible were designed for hunting down commerce raiders and dominating other cruisers in a one-on-one battle. They were criticized for their weak armament compared to their size and their high upkeep cost. However, they had excellent sea keeping, high speed, and long range, all of which required space and tonnage.
$LoadingScreens_Text_263;The *Diadem-class* was a series of eight protected cruisers of the Royal Navy, built during 1896–1903. They were an economic version of the preceding “Powerful” class and were criticized for their lack of big guns, small armor and average speed. They were the last British protected cruisers, giving later their place to the “armored cruiser” type of ships.
$LoadingScreens_Text_264;The *Cressy-class* were six armored cruisers built for the Royal Navy in 1898–1902. Their pair of 9.2-inch guns and heavier armor were their main advantages over the preceding Diadem class. On the outbreak of the First World War, Cressy, Hogue and Aboukir were sunk on 22 September 1914 by the German submarine U-9 near the Dutch coast.
$LoadingScreens_Text_265;The *Drake-class* was an enlarged and improved version of the Cressy-class designed by Sir William White, Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy. The ships of the class displaced 14,150 long tons and could travel at 23 knots. Their main armament was two 9.2-inch guns mounted in single turrets. Sixteen 6-inch casemate guns comprised their secondary armament.
$LoadingScreens_Text_266;The *Monmouth-class* of 10,000 ton armored cruisers built during 1901–1904 for the Royal Navy were specifically designed for commerce protection. Their small size and 6-inch guns made them adequate for their specialized role and their high speed of 23 knots helped them to evade stronger enemies.
$LoadingScreens_Text_267;The *Devonshire-class* was a group of six armored cruisers built for the Royal Navy in 1902–1905. They displaced 10,850 tons and had four 7.5-inch guns mounted in single turrets, making their main armament slightly more powerful than the preceding Monmouth-class which had only two dual 6-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_268;The *Duke of Edinburgh-class* were two armored cruisers built for the Royal Navy in 1904–1906 designed to support the fleet rather than protect merchant shipping. The Duke of Edinburgh and Black Prince had six single 9.2-inch guns that made them sufficiently strong versus enemy capital ships.
$LoadingScreens_Text_269;The *Warrior-class* cruiser was a series of four armored cruisers built for the Royal Navy during 1903–1907. Their mix of six 9.2-guns and four 7.5-inch guns, all mounted in single turrets, provided high firepower. Combined with their speed of 23 knots and high operational range they rightfully gained a reputation of being one of the best British cruiser classes ever made.
$LoadingScreens_Text_27;Sections that are *completely destroyed* will not receive further damage from fire, but this fire may spread to adjacent sections.
$LoadingScreens_Text_270;The three *Minotaur-class* cruisers that were built between 1905–1909 for the Royal Navy were heavily armed. They displaced 14,800 tons and carried two twin 9.2-inch guns and ten single 7.5-inch guns, all mounted in turrets. Their armament was supplemented by sixteen 3-inch guns and five submerged torpedo tubes, two on each broadside, plus one mounted in the stern.
$LoadingScreens_Text_271;The *County-class* of heavy cruisers built for the Royal Navy in 1924–1928 were designed within the limits of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Such ships, with a displacement limit of 10,000 tons and 8-inch main guns were usually referred to as "treaty cruisers".
$LoadingScreens_Text_272;The *York-class* was the second and final class of 8-inch (203 mm) gunned heavy cruisers built for the Royal Navy under the terms of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty. They had a displacement of 8,500 tons, compared to the 10,000 tons of the preceding County-class, scaled down to allow more cruisers to be built from the limited defence budgets of the late 1920s.
$LoadingScreens_Text_273;The *Pearl-class* was a series of nine light cruisers or so called “third-class protected Cruisers” at that time, designed by Sir William White and built during 1889-1900. Their displacement was 2,575 tons and were armed with eight 4.7-inch guns, various smaller caliber guns and two submerged torpedo tubes. Their maximum speed was 19 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_274;The *Apollo-class* was a numerous group of twenty-one “Second-class protected cruisers” built for the Royal Navy between 1889–1901. They displaced 3,600 tons and their main armament comprised of two 6-inch guns, six 4.7-inch guns and two submerged torpedo tubes. They could reach the speed of 19.75 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_275;The *Astraea-class* was an eight-ship class of protected cruisers built for the Royal Navy during 1893–1896 as a direct improvement of the preceding Apollo-class. The increased displacement of 4,360 tons allowed them to carry many small caliber guns along with the two 6-inch main guns, as well as four submerged torpedo tubes. Their maximum speed was 19.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_276;The *Eclipse-class* of nine “second-class protected cruisers” was constructed for the Royal Navy in 1893–1897 and was an enlarged version of the preceding Astrea-class. Between 1903 and 1905, all the ships in the class except for Eclipse had their mixed armament replaced with a more uniform armament of eleven 6-inch, nine 3-inch and seven 1.85-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_277;The *Arrogant-class* were four protected cruisers built for the Royal Navy between 1895–1897. They had a reinforced bow intended to finish off crippled enemy ships by ramming. Another special feature of this class was the heavily armored conning tower, specially designed to sustain short range fire. The ship's armament was strengthened in 1903–04, with a homogeneous battery of ten 6-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_278;The *Pelorus-class* was composed of eleven "third-class" protected cruisers designed by Sir William White based on the earlier Pearl-class cruisers. They displaced 2,135 tons and were armed with eight QF 4-inch guns, eight 1.85-inch guns, three machine guns, and two 18-inch (450-mm) torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_279;The *Challenger-class* was a pair of “second-class” protected cruisers built for the Royal Navy in 1900-1905. At almost 6,000 tons they had enough engine space to provide a high speed of 21 knots. Their main armament was eleven quick-firing (QF) 6-inch (152 mm) guns supported by several smaller guns and two submerged torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_28;When a ship receives a critical hit, it suffers an *accuracy penalty due to the shaking of the hull* that dissipates over time.
$LoadingScreens_Text_280;The first *Town-class* was a group of twenty-one light cruisers built for the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy. They were long-range cruisers, designed to patrol the extended naval borders of the British Empire. Their displacement varied from 4,880 to 5,530 tons as well as their overall armament which was based on their 6-inch main guns. They were particularly fast for their era as they could reach the speed of 25 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_281;The first *Arethusa-class* cruisers were eight oil-fired light cruisers of the Royal Navy built in 1913–1915. Their steam turbines gave them a high speed of 28.5 knots which allowed them to lead destroyers in combat. Their armament comprised two 6-inch guns, six 4-inch guns, one anti-air craft gun and four submerged torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_282;The *C-class* was a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy built between 1914–1916.  All the ships of the class had names starting with the letter C and were designed to withstand the rough conditions of the North Sea. They had a maximum speed of 28.5 knots and were armed with two 6-inch guns, eight 4-inch guns and four torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_283;The *Danae-class* or otherwise known “D-class” was a series of light cruisers built for the Royal Navy between 1918 and 1922. As an improved version of the preceding C-class, they were larger, reaching the displacement of 5,925 tons, allowing them to carry several more 6-inch guns, triple deck torpedo tubes and achieve the speed of 29 knots. Most of these ships were refitted and served in World War II.
$LoadingScreens_Text_284;The *Emerald-class* or E-class was a group of two light cruisers ordered by the Royal Navy in 1918 - towards the end of World War I. Completed after the war they were large for their class, displacing about 7,500 tons. Most of the extra tonnage, compared to the previous Danae-class, was allocated to engines, which provided a very high speed of 33 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_285;The *Leander-class* was a class of eight light cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. They were named after mythological figures, and all ships saw service in World War II. They displaced about 7,200 tons and were armed with eight 6-inch naval guns in twin turrets, four single 4-inch guns, several anti-aircraft guns, triple torpedo tubes and could carry two catapult-launched airplanes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_286;The *Arethusa-class* of light cruisers built for the Royal Navy between 1933 and 1937 were a compact version of the Leander-class. Their smaller displacement of about 5,200 tons did not allow the heavier armament of the Leanders but they had the same high speed of 32.5 knots and the same armor protection scheme.
$LoadingScreens_Text_287;The *Town-class* of light cruisers built for the Royal Navy during 1934–1939 were designed to the constraints of the London Naval Treaty. The ten ships of the class had minimum displacement which varied between 9,000-10,000 tons and were distinct for their triple turrets of 6-inch guns and their radar. During World War II all of them were reconstructed to support their max load, by fitting extra AA guns and other weaponry.
$LoadingScreens_Text_288;The *A-class* was a group of torpedo boat destroyers (TBD) built for the Royal Navy during 1892–1895. They were distinguished according to their speed to two sub-classes, the "26-knotters" and "27-knotters". Their displacement varied from 188 to 345 tons and carried up to two 18-inch deck torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_289;The *D-class* of British torpedo boat destroyers was built during 1895–1899 and was rather uniform in design. All vessels had 30 knots top speed, two funnels and the characteristic "turtleback" forecastle. Their displacement varied between 355 and 370 tons and they carried a pair of 18-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_29;*The ship that inflicts the first hits* usually gains significant advantage, depending on the inflicted damage. The damaged ship may suffer from temporary or permanent slowing down, making it an easy target, while penalties apply to its accuracy due to the instability caused to the hull.
$LoadingScreens_Text_290;The *River-class* or E-class as it was later re–designated, was a series of torpedo boat destroyers built for the Royal Navy in 1903–1905. The class introduced new features to destroyer design, focusing more on seakeeping and endurance and less on a high maximum speed in good weather. Those vessels displaced about 550 tons, carried two deck torpedo launchers and could reach 25.5 knots speed.
$LoadingScreens_Text_291;The *Tribal-class* or F-class was a class of destroyers built for the Royal Navy between 1905 and 1908 and saw service during World War I in the North Sea and English Channel. Compared to the preceding River-class, they had almost the double displacement (860-940 tons), much higher speed of 33 knots and mounted up to five 3-inch guns.  Their main armament was two 18-inch deck torpedo launchers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_292;The *Beagle-class* or G-class was a series of destroyers built in 1909–1910 for the Royal Navy and saw extensive service in the Dardanelles Campaign. In comparison to the preceding Tribal-class, they used coal fired engines and had a larger operational range. So, although their displacement was about the same (874–955 tons) their less space for engine machinery resulted in a lower speed of 27 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_293;The *Acorn-class* (re-designated H-class in 1913) was a series of twenty destroyers of the Royal Navy built between 1910 and 1911. The Acorns served during World War I and had oil-fired engines, so although they had smaller displacement than the preceding Beagle-class, their reduced fuel weight and increased engine efficiency allowed them to carry heavier weapons and reach the very high speed of 35.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_294;The *Acheron-class* (re-designated I-class in 1913) was a class of twenty-three destroyers of the British Royal Navy, all built between 1911 and 1912. The class was considerably heterogenous in the design, especially in their propulsion system which provided speeds from 27 to 35 knots. All the ships were considered excellent in sea keeping and carried the standard destroyer weaponry including two deck torpedo launchers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_295;The *Acasta-class* destroyers or K-class were built during 1912–1913 for the Royal Navy. They were a considerable upgrade to the preceding classes, having higher displacement of 934 to 984 tons and carrying three quick firing 4-inch guns. They had a speed of 29 to 32 knots and mounted two 21-inch deck torpedo launchers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_296;The *Laforey-class* or L-class was a series of 22 destroyers of the Royal Navy built between 1913–1915.  They had a high displacement of 965 to 1,010 tons which allowed the mounting of two twin 21-inch torpedo tubes and three quick firing 4-inch guns. Their maximum speed was 29 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_297;The *M-class*, widely known as the “Admiralty M-class”, was a series of 85 destroyers built for the Royal Navy during 1912–1913. Most of the ships had a standardized design except 25 which had minor variations by three specialist builders. Their 1,010 tons of displacement supported two twin 21-inch torpedo tubes, three quick firing 4-inch guns and the very high speed of 34 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_298;The first *R-class* was a series of 62 destroyers built between 1916 and 1917 for the Royal Navy. They were a slight improvement of the earlier Admiralty M-class destroyers featuring greater operational range and a higher speed of 36 knots.  Their displacement was slightly smaller (991 tons) but had the standard armament of two twin 21-inch torpedo tubes and three quick firing 4-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_299;The *S-class* was a group of 67 destroyers built for the Royal Navy between 1918 and 1920. These 1,000 tons ships had a maximum speed of 36 knots and carried two twin and two single torpedo launchers. Their main guns were three quick firing 4-inch guns supported by two smaller secondaries.
$LoadingScreens_Text_30;*When funnels are destroyed* their smoke emission becomes uncontrollably high, deteriorating the accuracy of the ship. Moreover, the ship’s speed and maneuverability are hindered, because boilers’ efficiency deteriorates.
$LoadingScreens_Text_300;The *V and W class* of British destroyers built during 1916–1924 consisted of several similar classes but was treated as one class. They were among the most powerful and advanced ships of their type in the world, featuring displacement of 1,207 tons, four 4-inch guns, one 3-inch gun and two twin torpedo launchers. They had a high operational speed and could reach the speed of 34 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_301;The *Admiralty type leader*, also known as the Scott-class, was a group of eight destroyer leaders designed and built for the Royal Navy towards the end of World War I. The function of the Destroyer Leader (DL) was to carry the flag staff of a destroyer flotilla, therefore they were enlarged to host additional crew, offices and signalling equipment. These 1,500 ton ships were armed with five 4.7-inch guns, two triple torpedo tubes and could travel at 36.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_302;The *Thornycroft type leader* or Shakespeare-class was a class of five destroyer leaders built for the Royal Navy towards the end of World War I. These 1,500-ton ships were very similar to the “Admiralty type leader”, but had broad, slab-sided funnels characteristic of Thornycroft designs. The design was used as the basis for several ships built for foreign navies in the 1920s.
$LoadingScreens_Text_303;The *A- and B-class destroyers* were a group of 18 destroyers built for the Royal Navy during 1928–1931, with two additional ships built for the Royal Canadian Navy. Their maximum displacement was about 1,800 tons plus 200 tons for some modified versions which were designated to function as Destroyer Leaders. Two quadruple torpedo tubes and four 4.7-inch guns were their main armament.
$LoadingScreens_Text_304;The *C- and D-class destroyers* were built during 1930–1933 for the Royal Navy and reached 1,920 tons of displacement at deep load. They were long range ships that achieved a high speed of 35.5 knots and were armed with four 4.7-inch guns, two 21-inch quadruple torpedo tubes, several AA guns and depth charges.
$LoadingScreens_Text_305;The *E- and F-class destroyers* were a group of 18 destroyers built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s. Technically they were a slight improvement over the previous C and D classes, featuring the same standard armament of four 4.7-inch guns and two 21-inch quadruple torpedo tubes but they had larger operational range.
$LoadingScreens_Text_306;The *G- and H-class destroyers* were a group of destroyers built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s. The design was a major export success with other ships built for the Brazilian, Argentine and Royal Hellenic Navies. They had a maximum displacement of 1,890 tons, maximum speed 35.5 knots and were armed with four 4.7-inch guns, two 21-inch quadruple torpedo tubes, several AA guns and depth charges.
$LoadingScreens_Text_307;The four *Brandenburg-class* pre-dreadnoughts were Germany's first ocean-going battleships and the first German warships fitted with wireless communications. The class comprised Brandenburg, Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm, Weissenburg, and Wörth, completed between 1893–1894. The Brandenburg-class battleships were unique for their era as they carried six large-caliber guns in three twin turrets, different from the standard of four guns in two turrets.
$LoadingScreens_Text_308;The *Brandenburg-class* was a series of German pre-dreadnought battleships built during 1890–1894.  They displaced 10,670 tons and their main armament was three twin 11-inch guns of no uniform caliber. They also carried eight 4.1-inch guns, eight 3.5-inch guns and three submerged torpedo tubes. The Brandenburgs were not particularly fast as their maximum speed was 16.9 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_309;The *Kaiser Friedrich III-class* was a series of five pre-dreadnought battleships of the German Kaiserliche Marine built during 1895–1901. All the 11,000 tons ships carried armament consisted of two twin 9.4-inch guns and many small quick-firing guns. This lighter and rapid firing armament intended to destroy the superstructure of enemy battleships and demoralize the crew.  In the following years it was proven inferior versus Dreadnoughts armed with fewer but very heavy guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_31;*The towers of the ship* contribute to its accuracy and damage control systems. When towers become hit, the armored conning tower and the fire control systems may also become damaged, deteriorating the accuracy. When a tower becomes destroyed, all the related bonuses are lost.
$LoadingScreens_Text_310;The *Wittelsbach-class* was a group of five pre-dreadnought battleships of the Imperial German Navy built during 1899–1904 as an improvement of the preceding Kaiser Friedrich III-class. The new class had about the same armament, but was slightly larger featuring a full flush deck, allowing more space for engines and fuel, and consequently a higher speed of 18 knots and almost twice the range.
$LoadingScreens_Text_311;The *Braunschweig-class* was a series of five pre-dreadnought battleships of the Kaiserliche Marine built in 1901–1906. These ships of 14,400 tons were an improvement of the previous Wittelsbach-class, featuring two larger twin 11-inch guns and stronger armor while retaining the same speed of 18 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_312;The *Deutschland-class* was a group of five pre-dreadnought battleships of the German Kaiserliche Marine built between 1903 and 1908. These 14,000 tons ships were similar to the preceding Braunschweig-class, featuring stronger armor and comparable armament of two twin 11-inch guns and many smaller caliber guns. They were considered obsolete before they were even completed by the launch of the revolutionary HMS Dreadnought in 1906.
$LoadingScreens_Text_313;The *Nassau-class* was the first dreadnought battleship built for the German Navy as a response to the "all big gun" British HMS Dreadnought. Four ships belonged to this class and had a maximum displacement of 21,000 tons. Compared to their British counterparts they were a little slower and carried smaller main guns (11-inch rather than 12-inch) but had thicker armor. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_314;The *Helgoland-class* was the second series of German dreadnought battleships that was built from 1908 to 1912, featuring four ships: Helgoland, Oldenburg, Ostfriesland and Thüringen. It was a larger and improved version of the previous Nassau-class ships, presenting a larger main battery (12-inch) and a bigger engine system providing a higher top speed of 20.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_315;The *Kaiser-class* was the third series of German dreadnoughts battleships, the first to feature turbine engines and superfiring turrets.  Five ships were built during 1909-1913 and served in the Imperial German Navy during World War I. As was usual for German battleships of the period, the Kaiser class mounted main guns that were smaller than those of their British rivals but had much stronger armor.
$LoadingScreens_Text_316;The *König-class* was the third series of German dreadnought battleships consisting of the König, Grosser Kurfürst, Markgraf, and Kronprinz. They were the most powerful warships of the German Fleet at the outbreak of World War I, featuring a maximum displacement of 28,100 tons and a main armament of five twin 12-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_317;The *Bayern-class* was a series of super-dreadnought battleships built by the German Kaiserliche Marine, originally planned to include four ships: Bayern, Baden, Sachsen, and Württemberg. Construction started shortly before World War I in 1913, but due to the increased war expenditures, only the first two were completed.  They were distinguished for their powerful battery of four twin 15-inch guns and their very thick armour.
$LoadingScreens_Text_318;The *Scharnhorst-class* were a series of German war ships, classified as either battleships or battlecruisers, and the first built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine after World War I. The class comprised two vessels: Scharnhorst and Gneisenau that had a standard displacement of 32,100 tons and a main battery of nine 11-inch guns in three triple turrets. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_319;The *Bismarck-class* was a pair of battleships, the biggest ever built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine. Their construction started shortly before the outbreak of World War II. Bismarck had a maximum displacement of 50,300 tons, a main battery of four twin 15-inch guns and could reach the speed of 30 knots. Tirpitz was completed one year later and had a slightly larger displacement, stronger engines, different AA gun arrangement and 21-inch deck torpedo launchers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_32;You can design the following ship types: Battleship, Battlecruiser, Heavy Cruiser, Light Cruiser, Destroyer and Torpedo Boat. For each ship type, newer hulls become available as technology develops. Each hull has four basic characteristics which give to the hull unique base statistics. These are: *Resistance*, *Hull Form*, *Stability* and *Floatability*.
$LoadingScreens_Text_320;The *Moltke-class* was a pair of battlecruisers of the German Imperial Navy built between 1909–1911, consisting of SMS Moltke and SMS Goeben. These battlecruisers were a significant improvement over the previous Von der Tann design. They were larger with maximum displacement of 25,400 tons, faster as they could reach 25.5 knots speed, better armored, and had two more twin turrets featuring a main battery of six twin 11-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_321;*SMS Seydlitz* represented the third battlecruiser design of the Imperial German Navy and was built between 1911–1913 in Hamburg. She had a maximum displacement of 28,550 tons, mounted five twin 11-inch guns and was very fast as she could reach the speed of 26.5 knots. At the Battle of Jutland, she was hit 21 times by heavy caliber shells and a torpedo but she survived the battle.
$LoadingScreens_Text_322;The *Derfflinger-class* was a group of three battlecruisers of the Imperial German Navy that were built between 1913–1917. The preceding Moltke and Seydlitz classes became an outdated battlecruiser generation, as the Derfflinger class was much larger (31,200 tons) and superior in all terms. The Derfflingers had very thick armor, oil fired engines which provided larger range and a bigger main battery of 12-inch guns mounted in four twin turrets.
$LoadingScreens_Text_323;*SMS Fürst Bismarck* was the first armored cruiser of the Imperial German Navy and was built in 1896–1897. The design was an improvement over the preceding Victoria Louise-class protected cruiser, featuring 11,461 tons of displacement and 18.7 knots maximum speed. Her armament comprised two twin 9.4-inch guns, multiple secondaries of 5.9 and 3.5-inch calibers, as well as six torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_324;The *Prinz Adalbert class* was a group of two armored cruisers built in 1900–1901 for the German Kaiserliche Marine. They were armed with a main battery of four 8.3-inch guns, a significant improvement over the previous armored cruiser, Prinz Heinrich, which carried only two such guns. These ships of about 10,000 tons carried multiple secondary guns of smaller caliber, four torpedo tubes and their top speed was 20 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_325;*SMS Prinz Heinrich* was a unique German armored cruiser constructed in 1902 for the Imperial German Navy. Prinz Heinrich's design was a lighter version of the previous armored cruiser, Fürst Bismarck. She was nearly 2,000 tons lighter due to having thinner armor and fewer secondary guns but had a higher speed of 20 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_326;*SMS Blücher* was the last armored cruiser of the German Empire and was built between 1907 and 1909. She had a maximum displacement of 17,500 tons, six twin 8.3-inch guns and a maximum speed of 25.4 knots. Although larger than the preceding armored cruisers and with heavier guns, she was unable to match the size and armament of the battlecruisers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_327;The *Deutschland-class* was a series of three heavy cruisers built for the German Navy during 1929–1936. They were classified as Panzerschiffe ("armored ships") by the Germans while the British called them “Pocket Battleships” due to their very heavy guns, two triple 11-inch guns, which were unusual for a ship of 10,000 tons.
$LoadingScreens_Text_328;The *Deutschland-class* of German heavy cruisers was represented by the ships: “Deutschland”, “Admiral Scheer” and “Admiral Graf Spee”. In theory, they fulfilled the displacement limit of 10,000 tons set by the Treaty of Versailles but under full load they could reach almost 15,000 tons. Despite this violation, their design incorporated radical innovations to save weight. They were the first warships that utilized welding and full diesel propulsion. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_329;The *Admiral Hipper class* was a group of five heavy cruisers built by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in the mid-1930s. The class comprised Admiral Hipper, Blücher, Prinz Eugen, Seydlitz, and Lützow. Only the first three ships were built. The rest remained incomplete due to the financial shortages caused by World War II.
$LoadingScreens_Text_33;Destroyers and Light Cruisers are able to lay *Smoke Screen* to hide themselves and nearby friendly ships. Smoke Screen reduces visibility and obstructs targeting for as long it is active. Smoke screen can endure several minutes and needs quite some time to become available again.
$LoadingScreens_Text_330;The *Admiral Hipper class* was a group of five heavy cruisers built by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in the mid-1930s. At full load they displaced 18,500 tons and their main armament was four twin 8-inch guns. Their secondary armament comprised 32 guns of smaller caliber and 12 torpedo tubes mounted in four triple launchers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_331;The *Gazelle-class* was the first modern light cruiser design of the German Imperial Navy and comprised ten ships built between 1897 and 1901. Although smaller than the typical light cruisers of the time (about 3,000 tons) they had a powerful armament of ten 4.1-inch guns and two torpedo tubes. They were also particularly fast, reaching 21.5 knots of speed.
$LoadingScreens_Text_332;The *Bremen-class* was a group of seven light cruisers of the Imperial German built during 1903–1905. Compared to the previous Gazelle-class, they were larger (3,797 tons), faster (22 knots max. speed) and better armored. Their armament was the same, featuring ten 4.1-inch guns and a pair of torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_333;The *Königsberg-class* was a group of four light cruisers built for the German Imperial Navy in 1905–1907. They were an improvement on the preceding Bremen-class, being slightly larger and faster, and mounting the same armament of ten 4.1-inch guns and two torpedo tubes. All ships saw extensive service during World War I.
$LoadingScreens_Text_334;The *Dresden-class* was a pair of light cruisers built for the Imperial German Navy during 1906–1909 that had rich service during World War I. The class comprised SMS Dresden, the lead ship, and SMS Emden. They were an improvement over the preceding Königsberg class, being slightly larger and slightly faster, but with the same primary armament of ten 4.1 in guns. They displaced 4,201 tons and their maximum speed was 24 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_335;The *Kolberg-class* was a group of four light cruisers built for the German Imperial Navy between 1908 and 1910 which had extensive service during the First World War. SMS Kolberg, Mainz, Cöln, and Augsburg had a displacement of 4,362 tons and maximum speed of 25.5 knots. Their armament comprised twelve 4.1-inch guns, four 2-inch guns and two torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_336;The *Magdeburg-class* was a group of four light cruisers built for the Imperial German Navy during 1910–1912. They were armed with a main battery of twelve 4.1-inch guns, and later three of them were re-armed with more powerful 5.9-inch guns. They displaced 4,570 tons at full load and were rated at a top speed of 27.5 knots. Their quarterdeck was cut down to function also as mine layers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_337;The *Karlsruhe-class* was a pair of light cruisers built for the German Imperial Navy during 1911–1912. SMS Karlsruhe and Rostock were very similar to the previous Magdeburg-class cruisers, mounting the same armament of twelve 4.1-inch guns and comparable armor protection, however they were larger and faster than the earlier ships. Their larger displacement of 6,191 tons was used for engine machinery which provided the top speed of 29,3 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_338;The *Pillau-class* was a pair of light cruisers built in Germany just before the start of World War I. SMS Pillau and Elbing were initially ordered for the Imperial Russian Navy in 1912 but they were confiscated by Germany after the war outbreak. They were the first German light cruisers to be equipped with 5.9-inch guns, of which they carried eight. Both ships had a maximum displacement of 5,262 tons and a top speed of 27.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_339;The *Wiesbaden-class* was a pair of light cruisers built by the German Imperial Navy shortly before the outbreak of World War I. Wiesbaden and Frankfurt displaced 6,601 tons and were armed with eight 5.9-inch guns, two 3.5-inch guns, four torpedo tubes and 120 mines. They had  a top speed of 27.5 knots. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_34;The *Surface Visibility* is the minimum distance from which a ship becomes visible if observed from sea level and is affected by hull size and objects mounted on it. Spotting boost received from the highest operational tower allows to trace ships beyond this range. If towers become destroyed, enemy ships can only be spotted according to their surface visibility.
$LoadingScreens_Text_340;*SMS Wiesbaden* was a light cruiser of the Imperial German Navy built during 1913–1915. She and her sister ship “SMS Frankfurt”, had a main armament of eight 5.9-inch guns, top speed of 27.5 knots and displaced 6,601 t at full load. Wiesbaden became the center of action during the Battle of Jutland while she was sinking, dragging both fleets in a dramatic clash near her. Eventually only one of her crew members survived.
$LoadingScreens_Text_341;The *Königsberg-class* was a group of four light cruisers of the German Imperial Navy built during World War I, between 1914 and 1917. The class comprised Königsberg, Karlsruhe, Emden, and Nürnberg, all of which were named after light cruisers lost earlier in the war. The ships were an incremental improvement over the preceding Wiesbaden-class cruisers. They had a displacement of 7,012 tons, top speed of 27.5 knots and a main armament of eight 5.9-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_342;The *Brummer-class* was a group of two mine-laying cruisers built for the Imperial German Navy in World War I: SMS Brummer and SMS Bremse. Although most German cruisers were fitted for mine-laying, the need for more specialized ships urged for the construction of these light cruisers which could carry up to 400 mines, compared to the typical load of 150 mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_343;The *Cöln-class* of light cruisers was Germany's last warship class constructed before her defeat in World War I. Only two were completed from the planned ten ships: Cöln and Dresden. The design was a slightly modified version of the preceding Königsberg-class, featuring a displacement of 7,486 tons, main armament of eight 5.9-inch guns, four torpedo tubes and the capability to load 200 mines. Their maximum speed was 27.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_344;*Emden* was a light cruiser built by the Reichsmarine during 1921–1925. She was the only ship of her class and was the first large warship built in Germany after the end of World War I. Her design followed the strict restrictions of the Allied disarmament commission. She had a displacement of 7,100 tons and was armed with a main battery of eight 5.9-inch guns of World War I technology. Her top speed was 29.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_345;The second *Königsberg-class* or K-class, was a class of light cruisers of the German Navy. They were the first German modern cruisers following the preceding Emden-class which was based on World War I-era design. The class comprised three ships of 7,800 tons, all built between 1926 and 1930. They were armed with a main battery of nine 5.9-inch guns, twelve 20-inch torpedo tubes and could carry 120 mines. Their maximum speed was 32 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_346;The *Leipzig-class* was a class of two light cruisers: Leipzig, the lead ship, and Nürnberg, which was built to a slightly modified design. The ships were improvements over the preceding Königsberg-class cruisers, being slightly larger, with a more efficient arrangement of the main battery and improved armor protection. Leipzig was built between 1928 and 1931, and Nürnberg followed between 1934 and 1935.
$LoadingScreens_Text_347;The *S90-class* was a group of large torpedo boats built for the German Imperial Navy between 1899–1907. They were designated as "High seas torpedo boats", able to operate in open waters. Their maximum displacement was 544 tons, they had a top speed of 28 knots and carried 3 torpedo tubes. They also had 3 guns that varied in caliber from 2-inch to 3.46-inch.
$LoadingScreens_Text_348;The *S138-class* was a group of sixty-five torpedo boats built for the German Imperial Navy during 1906–1911. All the vessels served with the German fleet except four which were sold to the Ottoman Empire in 1910.

$LoadingScreens_Text_349;The *V1-class* was a series of 26 large torpedo boats built for the Imperial German Navy during 1911-1913.  Two of those vessels were sold to Greece in 1912 which later participated in the Balkan Wars and World War I. This class of torpedo boats had a maximum displacement of 697 tons and mounted four torpedo tubes and two 3.5-inch guns. Their top speed was 32 knots and they could carry up to 18 mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_35;The *Radar* is a device that is mounted on ship towers and allows the detection of ships beyond visibility range, showing the direction and coordinates of the nearest enemy ship, with an error margin. Furthermore, the Radar improves significantly the aiming of guns over long distances.
$LoadingScreens_Text_350;The *B97-class* was a series of eight destroyers built for the Imperial German Navy during the First World War (1914–1915). The maximum displacement of those ships was 1,843 tons at deep load and they had a top speed of 36 knots. They were armed with six torpedo tubes and four 3.5-inch guns while they could carry up to 24 mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_351;The *G101-class* was a series of four destroyers of the Imperial German Navy. They were first ordered by the Argentine Navy from the German shipyard Germaniawerft in 1912 but at the outbreak of the First World War -in August 1914- they were seized on behalf of Germany. They had a maximum displacement of 1,734 tons and could reach the speed of 33.5 knots. They were armed with six torpedo tubes and four 3.5-inch guns while they could carry up to 24 mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_352;The *Type-23 destroyers* were built for the German Navy after World War I as replacement to vessels lost during the war conflict. Six ships were built in 1926 and 1927 and all of them participated later in World War II. Their displacement was 1,290 tons at full load and had a top speed of 33.6 knots. Their main armament comprised six torpedo tubes and four 4.1-inch guns. They could also carry up to 30 mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_353;The *Type-24 destroyers* of the German Navy were an improvement over the previous Type-23 class. They were known as the Raubtier class (Predator class) and six of them were built during 1928–1929. They displaced 1,298 tons and could reach the speed of 35.2 knots. They were armed with six torpedo tubes, three 4.1-inch guns, two machine guns and could host up to 30 mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_354;The *Imperator Aleksandr II-class* was a pair of battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy during 1885–1891. Construction was very prolonged and these ships of 9,932 tons were virtually obsolete when completed, mainly because of their very slow speed (15 knots) and their weak main armament. They had only one turret of two 12-inch guns accompanied by numerous secondary guns of small caliber.
$LoadingScreens_Text_355;*Dvenadsat Apostolov* was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Russian Navy during 1888–1892, the sole ship of her class. She had a displacement of 8,850 tons and a low maximum speed of 15 knots, mainly because of her heavy armor of outdated technology. Her armament comprised two twin 12-inch guns, several secondaries and four submerged torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_356;*Navarin* was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Russian Navy during 1890–1896. This ship of 10,370 tons had a pair of twin 12-inch main guns and strong secondary armament. Her outdated compound armor was particularly thick, reaching 16 inches on the belt affecting her maximum speed which was only 15 knots. Navarin was sunk by Japanese mines at the Battle of Tsushima.
$LoadingScreens_Text_357;*Rostislav* was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the Imperial Russian Navy built during 1896–1900. She was designed to have 9,020 tons of displacement but poor construction practices increased it more than 1,600 tons. Half of the fire-tube boilers were coal-fired and the rest were oil-fired, making Rostislav the first capital ship in the world to use fuel oil. Her combat ability was compromised by the use of 10-inch guns instead of the 12-inch standard.
$LoadingScreens_Text_358;The *Peresvet-class* was a group of three pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy during 1898–1903. All three ships were lost in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. Peresvet and Pobeda participated in the Battles of Port Arthur and the Yellow Sea and were sunk during the Siege of Port Arthur. Oslyabya, the third ship, was sunk at the Battle of Tsushima with the loss of most of her crew.
$LoadingScreens_Text_359;The *Peresvet-class* was a group of three pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy during 1898–1903. Their displacement varied between 13,534-14,639 tons and their maximum speed was 18 knots. Their main armament was two twin 10-inch guns accompanied by numerous secondary guns of smaller caliber. The ships also had five submerged torpedo tubes and carried 45 mines that could be laid to protect their anchorage in remote areas.
$LoadingScreens_Text_36;The invention of *Radio* Telegraph enhances significantly the naval communications that previously relied upon flag or light signals over short distances. Ships within the Radio communication range of the Flagship gain combat bonuses. The Radio technology allows the earliest form of Radar, called *RDF or "Radio Direction Finder"* which reveals the direction of the closest concealed enemy ship, with an error margin.
$LoadingScreens_Text_360;*Potemkin* was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Russian Navy throughout 1898–1905. She became famous when her crew rebelled against their officers during the 1905 Russia’s uprising. After the end of the mutiny, the ship was returned to Imperial service and was renamed to “Panteleimon”.
$LoadingScreens_Text_361;*Potemkin* was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Russian Navy throughout 1898–1905 that became famed when her crew rebelled against their officers during 1905 Russia’s revolution. Potemkin was slightly overweight compared to the initial design, reaching 13,100 of displacement. The ship had a main battery of two twin 12-inch guns and a very strong secondary armament. Her maximum speed was rather low, not exceeding 16 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_362;*Retvizan* was a pre-dreadnought battleship built during 1899–1902 for the Imperial Russian Navy. She was constructed in the USA since Russian shipyards were at full capacity at that time. Retvizan had a typical design mounting two twin 12-inch guns as main armament and featuring numerous secondaries for protection against torpedo boats and other smaller vessels. The ship displaced 12,912 tons and had 18 knots top speed.
$LoadingScreens_Text_363;*Tsesarevich* was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the Imperial Russian Navy that was built in France throughout 1899–1903. The ship's design formed the basis of the Russian-built Borodino-class battleships. During the Russo-Japanese War, she was torpedoed in a surprise attack on Port Arthur War, but was not sunk. After being repaired she participated in various other conflicts until 1918 when she was eventually scrapped. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_364;*Tsesarevich* was a French-built battleship of the Imperial Russian Navy, constructed during 1899–1903. Tsesarevich's most obvious design feature was her tumblehome hull. She used an advanced Krupp armor scheme and had a displacement of 13,105 tons while her top speed was 18 knots. Her main armament were consisted of two 12-inch guns that were accompanied by an impressive number of smaller secondary guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_365;The *Borodino-class* was a group of five pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy during 1899–1905. Their design was based on the French-built Tsesarevich modified to use Russian equipment. Three of these ships were sunk and one was captured by the Imperial Japanese Navy at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_366;The *Borodino-class* was a group of five pre-dreadnought battleships based on the French-built Tsesarevich. They were constructed for the Imperial Russian Navy during 1899–1905 in Russian shipyards. Their displacement varied between 14,317-14,646 tons and their top speed was 18 knots. Two twin 12-inch guns, dozens of smaller guns and four torpedo tubes comprised their armament. Compared to Tsesarevich, they used a lighter Krupp armor and their equipment was solely of Russian technology. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_367;The *Andrey Pervozvanny class* were two pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy during 1904–1911 as an incremental development of the Borodino-class battleships with an increased displacement of 17,600 tons and heavier secondary armament of 8-inch and 4.7-inch guns. Their main armament was two twin 12-inch guns. Their armor was extensive but not too thick while they had a top speed of 18 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_368;The *Gangut-class*, also known as the "Sevastopol class", were the first dreadnoughts built for the Imperial Russian Navy and they operated in the Baltic Sea. Four ships were constructed between 1909 and 1914 named “Gangut”, “Petropavlovsk”, “Sevastopol” and “Poltava” which had a displacement of 24,800 tons and a top speed of 24.1 knots. Their four triple 12-inch guns were arranged linearly on the centerline and were supported by sixteen 4.7-inch casemate guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_369;The *Imperatritsa Mariya-class* was the second series of dreadnoughts built for the Imperial Russian Navy. All three ships of the class were constructed during World War I. Compared to the previous Gangut-class, they had about the same displacement (23,413 tons) although they were shorter in length but they were more heavily armored and had stronger secondaries. Their extra armor and armament reduced their top speed to 21 knots, which was adequate for their service in the closed waters of the Black Sea.
$LoadingScreens_Text_37;Torpedoes have a minimum *Torpedo Detection* range according to their type. The ship Towers increase the range from which torpedoes can be detected. Further increase is offered by Hydrophone or Sonar equipment installed in the ship.
$LoadingScreens_Text_370;*Imperator Nikolai I* was a Russian dreadnought that was laid down during World War I for service in the Black Sea. The ship was designed to carry the same main armament as the preceding Imperatritsa Mariya class, while being larger and more heavily armored. Imperator Nikolai I was launched in 1916, but construction was suspended in 1917 due to the Russian Revolution. Eventually she was never completed and was scrapped in 1927.
$LoadingScreens_Text_371;*Rurik* was an armored cruiser built for the Imperial Russian Navy during 1890–1892. Her displacement was 11,960 tons, almost 1,000 more tons than designed and she had a top speed of 18 knots. Her main armament was four 8-inch guns accompanied by sixteen 6-inch guns, six torpedo tubes and several smaller guns. Rurik was sunk at the Battle of Ulsan in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05.
$LoadingScreens_Text_372;*Rossia* was an armored cruiser of the Imperial Russian Navy built in 1893–1896. She served as a long-range commerce raider in the Russo-Japanese War and was heavily damaged in the Battle of Ulsan. Nevertheless, she survived and later was refitted in World War I to carry improved armament and mine rails, managing to damage two light cruisers with one of her deployed minefields.
$LoadingScreens_Text_373;*Rossia* was an armored cruiser of the Imperial Russian Navy built in 1893–1896. She served as a long-range commerce raider in the Russo-Japanese War and was heavily damaged in the Battle of Ulsan. Rossia had a displacement of 12,391 tons, 19 knots top speed and was armed with four 8-inch guns, sixteen 6-inch guns, five torpedo tubes and several smaller guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_374;*Gromoboi* was an armored cruiser built for the Imperial Russian Navy in 1897–1900. She served as a long-range commerce raider during the Russo-Japanese War and was severely damaged in the Battle of Ulsan. This cruiser had a displacement of 12,655 tons, 19 knots top speed and was armed with four 8-inch guns, sixteen 6-inch guns, four torpedo tubes and many smaller caliber guns. During World War I she was refitted to function as a fast mine-layer.
$LoadingScreens_Text_375;The *Bayan-class* was a group of four armored cruisers built for the Imperial Russian Navy, during 1899–1911. The first two were built in France due to lack of shipyard capacity in Russia. The lead ship “Bayan” was the only one that participated in the Russo-Japanese War. She was sunk in Port Arthur but the Japanese salvaged her and put to service with the name “Aso”.
$LoadingScreens_Text_376;The *Bayan-class* was a group of four armored cruisers built for the Imperial Russian Navy, weighing about 7,900 tons, and having a top speed of 21 knots. The first “Bayan” and “Admiral Makarov” were built in France in 1899–1906. Two more ships again named “Bayan” (the first one was captured by the Japanese) and “Pallada” were built in Russia during 1905–1911. Pallada became known as the first Russian warship that was sunk in World War I.
$LoadingScreens_Text_377;The second armored cruiser named *Rurik* was built for the Imperial Russian Navy in British shipyards between 1905 and 1906 and participated in World War I. Rurik was armed with two twin 10-inch guns, four twin 8-inch guns, twenty 4.7-inch guns, four 1.9-inch guns and two torpedo tubes. Rurik was able to reach the speed of 21 knots and had a displacement of 15,170 tons.
$LoadingScreens_Text_378;The *Kirov-class* was a group of six heavy cruisers built in the late 1930s for the Soviet Navy. Their design was based on Italian cruiser Raimondo Montecuccoli and they were the first large warships built by the Soviets after the Russian Civil War. The Kirovs had a maximum displacement of 9,436 tons and a top speed of 36 knots. They were armed with three triple 7.1-inch guns, many small caliber guns and two triple torpedo tubes. They could also carry numerous mines and depth charges.
$LoadingScreens_Text_379;The Russian protected cruiser *Admiral Kornilov* was constructed between 1886–1887 in France. Her armament consisted of fourteen 6-inch guns, sixteen guns of small caliber and six 15-inch torpedo tubes. She had a displacement of 5,957 tons and was capable of 17.6 knots speed. After 1908 she was used as a torpedo boat training ship and in 1911 was removed from service.
$LoadingScreens_Text_38;Ships automatically manage their *limited ammo* according to their targets. They will hold fire until the enemy is inside a meaningful attack range for their guns or torpedoes. This default aiming system can be made either strictier or unrestricted via the *Save*, *Hold* and *Aggressive* fire modes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_380;*Svetlana* was a protected cruiser of the Imperial Russian Navy built during 1895–97 in France that was used many times as a royal yacht in peacetime. The ship had a displacement of 3,924 tons and a top speed of 21 knots. The armament included six 6-inch guns, ten 1.9-inch guns and two torpedo tubes while she could carry up to 20 mines. She was sunk in combat during the Battle of Tsushima in the Russo-Japanese War.
$LoadingScreens_Text_381;The *Pallada-class* (not to be confused with the armored cruiser Pallada that was sunk in World War I) were among the first warships built in the Russian Shipyard of Saint Petersburg. The three protected cruisers of the class “Pallada”, “Diana” and “Aurora” were constructed between 1895–1903 and participated in the Russo-Japanese War. Aurora is still active in the Russian Navy serving as a museum ship.
$LoadingScreens_Text_382;The *Pallada-class* (not to be confused with the armored cruiser Pallada that was sunk in World War I) were three protected cruisers constructed during 1895–1903 in the Russian Shipyard of Saint Petersburg. Their displacement was between 6,764 and 7,008 tons and they had a maximum speed of 18 knots. Their armament included eight 6-inch guns and dozens of lighter guns. Three torpedo tubes supplemented their firepower.
$LoadingScreens_Text_383;*Varyag* was a protected cruiser of the Imperial Russian Navy built between 1898 and 1899 that became famous for her crew's heroism at the Battle of Chemulpo Bay. Varyag was capable of 23 knots speed and had a displacement of 6,604 tons. Her armament was heavy as she mounted twelve 6-inch guns, twelve 3-inch guns, ten guns of small caliber and six torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_384;*Novík* was a Russian protected cruiser that was built in Germany in 1900 as part of a program to reinforce the Russian Pacific Fleet with a 3000-ton class reconnaissance cruiser. The top speed of 25 knots made her one of the fastest cruisers in the world at that time. The ship’s armament included six 4.7-inch guns, eight lighter guns and five torpedo tubes. Novik was severely damaged and captured by the Japanese at the Battle of Korsakov.
$LoadingScreens_Text_385;The *Svetlana-class* was the first class of light cruisers ordered by the Imperial Russian Navy in 1913. Construction was long interrupted by World War I, the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War. Of the four ships ordered, only “Svetlana” was completed by the Soviet Union in 1928. The rest were converted to oil tankers or were scrapped. The ship served in the Black Sea Fleet with the name “Profintern”. In 1939 she was again renamed to “Krasnyi Krim” and supported Soviet troops during World War II.
$LoadingScreens_Text_386;*Svetlana* was a light cruiser that was first ordered by the Imperial Russian Navy in 1913 and was eventually completed in 1928 due to immense construction delays caused by World War I, the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War. She was a ship of 6,860 tons, capable of 29.5 knots and a main armament of fifteen 5.1-inch guns. She also carried four AA guns, two torpedo tubes and 100 mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_387;The *Admiral Nakhimov-class* was a group of four light cruisers ordered by the Imperial Russian Navy just before World War I began in 1914. Construction was long interrupted by World War I, the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War and eventually only two of the ships were completed, “Chervona Ukraina” in 1927 and “Krasny Kavkaz” in 1932. The second ship was heavily modified, featuring bigger guns and stronger AA. Both ships weighed 7,700 tons and had a top speed of 29.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_388;The *S-Class Torpedo Boats* of the Imperial Russian Navy had a displacement ranging from 186 to 290 tons. Their main armament comprised two torpedo tubes and two 3-inch (75mm) guns while they had a maximum speed of 27 knots. One specialized model (S-6) carried lighter armament but was also capable of deploying mines. All six torpedo boats of the class were captured by the Finns during the Finnish Civil War.
$LoadingScreens_Text_389;The *Leytenant Shestakov-class* was a group of four Destroyers built during 1905–1907 for the Imperial Russian Navy. They had a displacement of 640 tons and their top speed was 25 knots. Their armament included three torpedo tubes, one 4.7-inch gun and five 3-inch guns. One of those Destroyers, the “Leytenant Zatsarenni”, which was sunk in Black Sea by an Ottoman mine in 1917 was rediscovered in July 2007 by Russian divers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_39;The *Battleship* is the biggest and most expensive type of warship you can build. Battleships carry big guns that destroy smaller ships with a few shots. Their immense firepower and armor protection make them useful ships for any naval operation, but due to being so valuable, it is risky to send them to combat without sufficient escort.
$LoadingScreens_Text_390;*Novík* was a destroyer built between 1910–1911 for the Russian Imperial Navy and represented a class of 52 similar other ships. She was considered one of the best Destroyers of the war, as she was the first powered by oil instead of coal and had the world’s fastest top speed of 37.3 knots. Novik had a maximum displacement of 1,590 tons and was armed with four twin torpedo tubes, four 4-inch guns, four machine guns and 60 mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_391;The *Derzky or Bespokoiny-class* was a group of 9 destroyers built during 1913–1914 for the Imperial Russian Navy just before World War I and were a smaller variation of the very successful destroyer Novik. They had a maximum speed of 34 knots and were armed with five twin torpedo tubes, three 4-inch guns, 80 mines and several AA and machine guns. These destroyers of 1,340 tons dominated the Black Sea, where the Ottoman Navy had no similar ships.
$LoadingScreens_Text_392;The *Orfey-class destroyers* of the Imperial Russian Navy were built for the Baltic Fleet as modified versions of the earlier destroyer Novik and Derzky class. These ships had a slightly smaller displacement of 1,440 tons but featured a heavier armament of three triple torpedo tubes and four 4-inch guns while they could also carry 50 mines. Their top speed was lower at 32 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_393;The *Izyaslav-class destroyers* of the Imperial Russian Navy were built in 1915 for the Baltic Fleet as modified versions of the Orfey class and the older Novik class Destroyers. They had a maximum displacement of 1,460 tons, 33 knots top speed and mounted five 4-inch guns and three triple torpedo tubes while they could carry up to 80 mines. These ships fought in World War I, Russian Civil War, Estonian War of Independence, and World War II.
$LoadingScreens_Text_394;The *Fidonisy or Kerch class* were a group of eight destroyers built for the Imperial Russian Navy during World War I. They served in the Black Sea Fleet and were considered an improved variant of the Russian destroyer Novik and the Derzky-class destroyers. At full load they displaced 1,580 tons and achieved 33 knots top speed. They were armed with four 4-inch guns, four triple torpedo tubes, two machine guns and 80 mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_395;*Charles Martel* was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the French Navy built during 1891–1893 which formed a class of similar ships named Carnot, Jauréguiberry, Bouvet, and Masséna. Her characteristic tumblehome hull had a displacement of 11,639 tons and carried a main battery of two 12-inch and two 10.8-inch guns in single turrets. Charles Martel was additionally armed with eight 5.46-inch guns and two submerged torpedo tubes while her top speed was 18 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_396;*Carnot* was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the French Navy built during 1891–1894, belonging to a class of similar ships based on the Charles Martel battleship. Those ships were sometimes considered ironclads due to their aged tumblehome design. Carnot weighed 11,954 tons and had a top speed of 17.8 knots. Two 12-inch and two 10.8-inch guns in single turrets were the main armament. Charles Martel was additionally armed with eight 5.46-inch guns and two submerged torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_397;*Bouvet* was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the French Navy built during 1893–1896 which belonged to the Charles Martel class. She was a ship of 12,000 tons armed with a main battery of two 12-inch and two 10.8-inch guns in individual turrets and had a top speed of 17.8 knots. Bouvet participated in the Dardanelles campaign where she struck an Ottoman mine and was sunk, taking down about 660 men of her crew.
$LoadingScreens_Text_398;*Masséna* was a french pre-dreadnought battleship of the Charles Martel class and was built during 1892–1895. When she was completed, Masséna displaced 11,735 tons, exceeding by over 900 tons her designed weight. A pronounced bow helped to improve her buoyancy but still she suffered from serious stability problems that negatively affected the accuracy of her guns, making Masséna a battleship of questionable effectiveness.
$LoadingScreens_Text_399;*Jauréguiberry* was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the French Navy launched in 1893 and completed in 1897.  She was one of the five ships of the Charles Martel Class, ranked as the heaviest (12,229 tons) and among the slowest (17 knots top speed). Compared to other ships of the class, she had the same main armament of two 12-inch and two 10.8-inch guns in single turrets but had more secondaries and torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_4;Ships *auto-target* enemies in an efficient manner. Capital ships with multiple main and secondary guns may decentralize their fire and target multiple enemies according to threat. So it is usually more useful to just maneuver your ships and let them choose their targets automatically.
$LoadingScreens_Text_40;The *Battlecruiser* is a special type of warship that combines the size and firepower of a battleship with the speed and maneuverability of a cruiser. Battlecruisers are superior compared to smaller cruisers and are ideal for distant commerce escort or raid operations, but they should avoid direct combat versus battleships of higher armor protection.
$LoadingScreens_Text_400;*Brennus* is considered the first pre-dreadnought battleship of the French Navy. Her building process started in 1889 and was completed in 1896. Brennus was the first French battleship that had a main battery mounted on the centerline and the first to use Belleville boilers. She was armed with three 13.4-inch guns (Twin Turret Fore, Single Turret Aft), ten 6.5-inch guns, eighteen smaller guns and four torpedo tubes. She had a displacement of 11,190 tons and a top speed of 18 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_401;The *République-class* was a pair of pre-dreadnought battleships of the French Navy consisting of “République” and “Patrie”. They were completed in 1906, at the same time as the British HMS Dreadnought, which was far superior in all aspects.  Nevertheless, the Republique-class was a distinct improvement over previous French battleships, featuring 14,605 tons of displacement, two twin 12-inch guns, numerous secondaries and a top speed of 19 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_402;The *Liberté-class* was a group of four pre-dreadnought battleships of the French Navy built between 1903 and 1908. HMS Dreadnought was completed one year before and rendered these ships obsolete before they entered service. The Liberté-class of 14,860 tons was an improvement over the previous République-class, having the same four twin 12-inch guns and equal top speed of 19 knots but also featuring thicker armor and a heavier secondary battery of 7.6-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_403;*Danton-class* was a group of six pre-dreadnought battleships built for the French Navy during 1907–1911. These ships of almost 20,000 tons carried a main battery of four twin 12-inch and six twin 9.4-inch guns accompanied by 26 secondary guns of small caliber. The triple-expansion steam engine provided a top speed of 19 knots. The lack of a uniform main battery and steam turbines rendered these ships inferior compared to HMS Dreadnought.
$LoadingScreens_Text_404;The *Courbet-class* represented the first French dreadnoughts which were built during 1910–1914. All four ships of the class (Courbet, France, Jean Bart, Paris) served in the Mediterranean Sea in World War I. They had a main armament of six twin 12-inch guns supported by twenty-six guns of smaller caliber and four torpedo tubes. At full load they displaced 25,579 tons and their armor had a maximum thickness of 11.8 inches while they could achieve the speed of 21 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_405;The *Bretagne-class* represented the first "super-dreadnoughts" of the French Navy. The three ships of the class (Bretagne, Provence, Lorraine) were built during the First World War between 1913 and 1915. They were an improvement of the previous Courbet-class, featuring bigger 13.4-inch guns in five twin turrets. These ships of 26,000 tons had also plenty of secondaries, four torpedo tubes and a maximum armor thickness of 13 inches while their top speed was 20 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_406;The *Dunkerque-class* was a pair of battleships constructed for the French Navy between 1932–1936. Dunkerque and Strasbourg were designed under the limitations of Washington’s Naval Treaty to feature a high maximum speed (31 knots) and sufficient firepower to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They accomplished this role in only 26,500 tons of standard displacement by saving weight as they mounted all main guns forward in two quadruple 13-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_407;The French *Battleship Richelieu* was ordered in 1935, as a counter of the Italian Littorio-class battleship. She was completed in 1939 and featured a main armament of eight 15-inch guns mounted in two quadruple turrets that were all placed forward. This unusual gun arrangement saved weight and aided this ship of 35,000 tons to satisfy the restrictions of naval treaties while achieving a high speed of 30 knots and very thick armor protection.
$LoadingScreens_Text_408;*Dupuy de Lôme* was built for the French Navy during 1890–1895 and she was considered the world’s first armored cruiser, although the belt armor was rather thin. Nevertheless, at 6,301 tons she was sufficiently armored and able to achieve 20 knots of top speed. Her two 7.6-inch main guns and six 6.4-inch secondary guns were turreted and well protected, while she had plenty of other smaller guns and four torpedo tubes. Presenting such capabilities, Dupuy de Lôme was well suited for commerce raiding. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_409;The *Amiral Charner class* was a group of four armored cruisers built for the French Navy during 1894–96. These ships which were more accurately rated as “Protected Cruisers” were designed as a smaller and cheaper version of the preceding “Dupuy de Lôme” cruiser. They had a displacement of 4,748 tons and a top speed of 17 knots while their main armament comprised two 7.6-inch guns supported by multiple secondaries and four torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_41;Cruisers are ships that fulfill various naval roles depending on their armor and weaponry. The *Light Cruisers* are suitable for distant commerce raiding or defense against enemy torpedo craft, while they can become especially harmful to battleships if they carry torpedo armament. The *Heavy Cruisers* have stronger armor and larger guns, so they are potentially more powerful at the cost of being more expensive and less maneuverable.
$LoadingScreens_Text_410;*Pothuau* was an armored cruiser of the French Navy built during 1895–97. This ship is more accurately described as a “Protected Cruiser” due to the light armor and small displacement of 5,460 tons. Pothuau was armed with two 7.6-inch guns, ten 5.5-inch guns, twenty smaller guns and five torpedo tubes. She exceeded her designed speed of 19 knots during her sea trials, reaching 19.2 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_411;*Jeanne d'Arc* was built for the French Navy during 1896–99 and was originally conceived as a large protected cruiser, but later the design was considered an armored cruiser. As such, she was regarded as unsuccessful, due to the light armament for her size and average armor thickness. This ship of 11,445 tons had a top speed of 21 knots and was armed with two 7.6-inch guns, thirty guns of smaller caliber and five torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_412;The *Gueydon-class* cruiser was a group of three armored cruisers built during 1897–1903 that were designed as a smaller and cheaper version of the preceding armored cruiser “Jeanne d'Arc”. They had a smaller displacement of 9,516 tons but their armament did not differ much, featuring two 7.6-inch guns, eight 6.4-inch guns, eighteen smaller guns and two torpedo tubes, while their speed was between 21-22 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_413;The *Dupleix-class* was a group of three armored cruisers built for the French Navy between 1897–1904. These ships had a displacement of 7,600 tons and were armed with two twin 6.5-inch guns, fourteen smaller guns and two torpedo tubes. Their maximum speed was 20 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_414;The *Gloire-class* was a group of five armored cruisers built for the French Navy during 1899–1902, as an improved and enlarged version of the preceding Gueydon-class. They had a displacement of 9,534 tons and could reach the speed of 21 knots. They were armed with two 7.6-inch guns, eight 6.5-inch guns, twenty-four smaller guns and five torpedo tubes. Their maximum armor thickness reached 6.8 inches and was used to protect the gun turrets.
$LoadingScreens_Text_415;The *Léon Gambetta-class* was a group of three armored cruisers built for the French Navy during 1901–1904, as a bigger and more advanced version of the preceding Gloire-class. These cruisers of 12,400 tons could reach the speed of 22 knots and were armed with two twin 7.6-inch guns, ten 6.4-inch guns in single and twin turrets, twenty-four 1.9-inch guns and two torpedo tubes. Their maximum armor thickness was 7.9 inches, used in turrets and the front conning tower.
$LoadingScreens_Text_416;*Jules Michelet* was an armored cruiser of the French Navy that was built between 1904–1908, as an advancement of the Léon Gambetta class. This ship of 13,105 tons was capable of 22.5 knots top speed and had a main armament of two twin 7.6-inch guns accompanied by twelve 6.5-inch guns, twenty-four 1.9-inch guns and two torpedo tubes. Her maximum armor thickness was 8 inches.
$LoadingScreens_Text_417;*Ernest Renan* was an armored cruiser built for the French Navy between 1903–1906. She was a ship of 13,644 tons, able to achieve a top speed of 23 knots. Her firepower was composed by two twin 7.6-inch guns, multiple other smaller guns as well as two torpedo tubes. Ernest Renan had an active duty in World War I, most notably in the hunting of the German Battlecruiser SMS Goeben.
$LoadingScreens_Text_418;The *Edgar Quinet class* was the last type of armored cruiser built for the French Navy. The two ships of this class, Edgar Quinet and Waldeck-Rousseau, were constructed during 1905–1911 as an improvement of the previous class, Ernest Renan. The newer cruisers of about 14,000 tons had a stronger and uniform main battery of 7.6-inch guns and a top speed of 23 knots, but they were no match against the Battlecruisers of that time.
$LoadingScreens_Text_419;*Louis-Émile Bertin* (March 23, 1840 – October 22, 1924) was a leading French naval engineer. During 1886–1890 he aided the modernization of the Japanese fleet as a Naval Advisor and designed many Japanese cruisers and torpedo boats. After returning to France he became the Director of Naval Construction and promoted the "Jeune École" philosophy which favoured the building of light warships for commerce raiding, instead of large battleships.
$LoadingScreens_Text_42;The *Destroyers* belong to a special type of warship that is specifically designed to carry strong torpedo armament and sufficient firepower to chase and destroy smaller craft, such as Torpedo Boats. Destroyers are particularly effective versus battleships, because their small size, speed and maneuverability allow them to approach and launch devastating torpedoes against them.
$LoadingScreens_Text_420;The *Duguay-Trouin class* of three light cruisers were the first major French warships built after World War I. Their construction process was defined by the Washington Naval Treaty and lasted from 1922 to 1927. They had a displacement of 9,350 tons at full load and were armed with four twin 6.1-inch guns, four triple torpedo tubes and four AA guns. They were fast cruisers of 30 knots top speed but had limited range.
$LoadingScreens_Text_421;*Émile Bertin* was a French light cruiser designed to operate as a destroyer flotilla leader or a minelayer. Constructed during 1931– 1935, she featured an armament of three triple 6-inch guns, four dual purpose 3.5-inch guns, supported by numerous other AA guns. Émile Bertin had a maximum displacement of 8,480 tons and could travel very fast at 34 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_422;The *La Galissonnière-class* was a group of six light cruisers of the French Navy that were completed in 1937 and had a rich service during World War II. They had a displacement of 9,120 tons and a main armament of three triple 6.0-inch guns. They also carried six quad 1.6-inch guns, two twin torpedo tubes and eight AA guns while they could mount one reconnaissance aircraft. Their top speed could reach 35 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_423;The *Duquesne-class* represented the first heavy cruisers of the French Navy that were defined by the Washington Naval Treaty. “Duquesne” and “Tourville” were built during 1924–1928 and satisfied exactly the treaty displacement of 10,000 tons but they could exceed it up to 12,200 tons at full load. They were very lightly armored for their class but were particularly fast as they could reach the speed of 34 knots. The main armament was four twin 8-inch guns supported by two triple torpedo tubes and a strong AA battery.
$LoadingScreens_Text_424;The *Suffren-class* was the second series of French heavy cruisers under the Washington Naval Treaty. Four ships were built between 1927 and 1931 as an improvement of the preceding Duquesne-class, offering a significantly better armor scheme at a lower top speed of 32 knots. Their standard displacement was about the same at 10,000 tons. Their armament was about equal, consisting of four twin 8-inch guns, two triple torpedo tubes and thirty AA guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_425;*Algérie* was the last French heavy cruiser that was built under the limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty. At full load, she exceeded the treaty displacement up to 13,641 tons. She had a top speed of 32 knots and very strong armor compared to previous French cruisers. The main armament was typical for French cruisers of those times, consisting of four twin 8-inch guns and two triple torpedo tubes, but her AA guns were somewhat lacking.
$LoadingScreens_Text_426;The *Alger-class* was a group of three protected cruisers of the French Navy. The ships Alger, Isly and Jean Bart were built between 1887–1893 and had a displacement of 4,313 tons and a top speed of 19 knots. Their main armament comprised four 6.3-inch and six 5.5-inch guns. Additional armament included twelve smaller guns and five underwater torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_427;*Friant-class* was a series of protected cruisers of the French Navy, built during 1891–1896. The three ships of the class: Friant, Bugeaud and Chasseloup Laubat, had a displacement of 3,982 tons and a maximum speed of 18.7 knots. Their main armament was six single 6.3-inch guns, supported by twenty guns of smaller caliber and two underwater torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_428;*Lavoisier* was a french protected cruiser that was built within the period 1896–1897. This ship of 2,300 tons could travel at 20 knots and was armed with four 5.5-inch, two 3.9-inch and eight 1.9-inch guns, as well as two torpedo tubes. Lavoisier served during World War I in the Atlantic, English Channel and the Mediterranean.
$LoadingScreens_Text_429;The *Catinat-class* was a pair of protected cruisers built for the French Navy during 1894–1899. The ships “Catinat” and “Protet” displaced 4,048 tons and had a top speed of 19.5 knots. Their main armament was four 6.3-inch guns, supported by twenty-four smaller guns and two underwater torpedoes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_43;The *Torpedo Boats* are the smallest war vessels you may build. Their small size combined with their high speed allow them to come dangerously close to battleships and unleash their powerful load of torpedoes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_430;The *Destrées-class* was a group of two protected cruisers of the French Navy, built between 1897–1899. "Destrées" and "Infernet" were ships of 2,428 tons that could travel at a speed of 20.5 knots. Their armament included two 5.4-inch, four 3.9-inch and eight 1.9-inch guns, as well as four underwater torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_431;*Châteaurenault* was an 8,200-ton protected cruiser of the French Navy that was built between 1895–1902 and served during World War I.  The ship had a maximum speed of 24 knots and was armed with two 6.5-inch, six 5.5-inch and fifteen smaller guns. In December 1917, Châteaurenault was sunk at the Ionian Sea by a German Submarine.
$LoadingScreens_Text_432;*D'Entrecasteaux* was a French protected cruiser built during 1896–1898. Displacing 8,123 tons, she could travel at the maximum speed of 19.5 knots. She was very well armored for her indicated class, reaching 9 inches of armor protection for her turrets and 10 inches for the conning tower. Her armament suited that of an armored cruiser, featuring two single 9.4-inch guns, thirty smaller guns and two underwater torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_433;*Guichen* was a protected cruiser of the French Navy built between 1897–1899. This ship had a displacement of 8,151 tons and could travel at 23.5 knots. The armament included two 6.5-inch, six 5.5-inch and twenty-one guns of smaller caliber, along with two underwater torpedo tubes. Guichen became known for helping Armenian resistors to escape from the Ottoman onslaught of 1915 and for the mutiny of her crew led by French communist Charles Tillon in 1919.
$LoadingScreens_Text_434;*Jurien de la Gravière* was the last protected cruiser of the French Navy and was built during 1897–1903. She had a displacement of 5,600 tons and a top speed of 22.9 knots. The main armament comprised eight 6.5-inch guns in single turrets, supported by sixteen guns of small caliber and two underwater torpedo tubes. Jurien de la Gravière had an active service during World War I, mainly in the Mediterranean Sea.
$LoadingScreens_Text_435;The *Durandal-class* was a group of four torpedo boats built for the French Navy during 1899–1900.  These vessels of about 300 tons were better described as “Torpedo Boat Destroyers” due to their increased size and armament compared to older classes. They carried two 15-inch torpedo tubes and were additionally armed with one 2.6-inch and six 1.9-inch guns. Their top speed was 26 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_436;The *Framée-class* was a group of four torpedo boat destroyers built for the French Navy during 1899–1900. They were visually similar to the preceding Durandal-class as they also had a turtleback bow to reduce water resistance and were weighing about 300 tons. Their other characteristics were almost identical, featuring two 15-inch torpedo tubes, one 2.6-inch and six 1.9-inch guns while they had the same top speed of 26 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_437;The *Pertuisane-class* was a group of four torpedo boats built for the French Navy during 1899–1900.  They had a displacement of 306 tons and were armed with two 15-inch torpedo tubes, one 2.6-inch gun and six 1.9-inch guns. As most French torpedo boats of that time, they had a turtleback bow and a maximum speed of 26 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_438;The *Arquebuse-class* was a large series of 20 torpedo boats built for the French Navy during 1900–04. All these ships fought in the First World War and two of them were sunk. They had a displacement of 323 tons and a top speed of 28 knots. Their armament consisted of one 2.6-inch gun, six 1.9-inch guns and two 15-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_439;The *Claymore-class* was a group of thirteen French torpedo boats that were constructed during 1904–09.  The French Navy classified them as Destroyers but their displacement of 356 tons was smaller than the standards of those times. The Claymores had speeds which varied from 28 to 30 knots and their main armament was two 17.7-inch torpedo tubes. They were additionally armed with one 2.6-inch and six 1.9-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_44;*Merchant ships* are not controllable by player, but they appear in convoy missions where you either have to protect or attack them. In the campaign, the destruction of Merchant Ships has an impact on the nation economy and War Victory Points. The ships might be armed with light guns, so you should be wary when approaching them with light warships.
$LoadingScreens_Text_440;The *Branlebas-class* was a group of ten torpedo boat destroyers built for the French Navy during 1905–09. They were armed with two 17.7-inch torpedo tubes, one 2.6-inch and six 1.9-inch guns and their top speed was 27.5 knots. Branlebas was the last 300-tonne destroyer which the French started to build from 1899, starting from the Durandal-class. All these vessels had a characteristic turtleback forecastle.
$LoadingScreens_Text_441;The *Spahi-class* was a group of seven destroyers built during 1906–12 and represented the next generation of torpedo armed ships for the French Navy after the preceding 300-ton classes. These bigger ships of 539 tons had a top speed of 28 knots and carried three 17.7-inch torpedo tubes and six 2.6-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_442;The *Voltigeur-class* was a pair of French destroyers whose design was based on the Spahi-class and were built during 1908–10. They had a maximum displacement of 590 tons and accomplished their speed of 28 knots with the help of a steam turbine that supported their two triple-expansion steam engines. As the Spahi-class, the Voltiguers were armed with three 17.7-inch torpedo tubes and six 2.6-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_443;The *Chasseur-class* was a group of four destroyers built during 1909–1910 for the French Navy.  All the ships except the first one -Chasseur- were equipped with oil-fired boilers making them the first French warships using this boiler technology. The Chasseurs were proven fast as they exceeded their designed speed of 28 knots and accomplished up to 31 knots. Their displacement was 520 tons and were armed with three 17.7-inch torpedo tubes and six 2.6-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_444;The *Bouclier-class*, or Casque-class, was a series of twelve destroyers of the French Navy built during 1910–1912. This class represented a new generation of 800-tonne class for French Destroyers and all of them featured oil-fired boilers, steam turbines and a uniform armament of two 3.9-inch/four 2.6-inch guns and two twin torpedo tubes. Other aspects were mixed, such as displacement, funnels and boiler equipment. Consequently, their top speed varied from 24 to 35.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_445;The *Bisson-class* was a group of six destroyers built for the French Navy between 1911–14. The displacement of these ships varied from 768 to 804 tons and their speed from 30 to 32 knots. However, they had a standard armament of two 3.9-inch/four 2.6-inch guns and two twin torpedo tubes. The class was named after the French Admiral Hippolyte Bisson who died heroically aboard the ship “Panayotis” in 1827 during the Greek War of Independence.
$LoadingScreens_Text_446;The *Enseigne Roux class* was a pair of destroyers built for the French Navy between 1913–15. They were practically an enlarged version of the previous Bisson-class, reaching a displacement of 1,075 tons at full load. They had a maximum speed of 30 knots and they were armed with two 3.9-inch, four 2.6-inch guns and two twin torpedo tubes. This was the standard French armament for French 800-tonne Destroyers at that time.
$LoadingScreens_Text_447;The *Aventurier-class* was a group of four destroyers built for the French Navy during 1911–14. They were larger than the standard French destroyers of that period, featuring a displacement of 930 tons and an armament of four 3.9-inch guns and four single 17.7-inch torpedo tubes. Their maximum speed was 32 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_448;The *Arabe-class* was a special group of twelve French destroyers that were built in Japan, as an export version of the Japanese “Kaba-class”. They were all completed in 1917 and were named after ethnic groups of the French Empire. These ships had a displacement of 685 tons, a top speed of 29 knots and were armed with one 4.7-inch gun, four 3-inch guns and two twin torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_449;The *Bourrasque-class* was a group of twelve destroyers built for the French Navy during 1923–1926. These destroyers had a displacement of 2,000 tons at full load and a top speed of 33 knots. They were armed with four 5-inch guns, six AA guns and two triple 21.7-inch torpedo tubes. All ships were named after types of wind and served in World War II in five different navies.
$LoadingScreens_Text_45;The *Resistance* of the hull affects the damage received from shell hits and torpedoes, after armor penetration. Additionally, it applies special slope design that increases the ricochet chances of incoming shells.
$LoadingScreens_Text_450;The *L'Adroit-class* was a group of fourteen destroyers built for the French Navy from 1926 to 1931 as a minor improvement over the previous Bourrasque-class. Although they were slightly larger, they had almost the same displacement, which reached 2,000 tons at full load. They also carried almost identical armament: four 5-inch guns, four AA guns and two triple 21.7-inch torpedo tubes, while they had the same 33 knots top speed.
$LoadingScreens_Text_451;The *Le Hardi class* was a group of destroyers constructed for the French Navy during the late 1930s. Eight ships were completed at the start of World War II, designed to operate together with the French battleships Dunkerque and Strasbourg. With a maximum displacement of 2,577 tons, they achieved the speed of 37 knots, while they were armed with one triple and two double torpedo tubes as well as three 5.1-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_452;The *Chacal-class* was a group of six large destroyers (contre-torpilleurs) built for the French Navy between 1924–1927 and designed to operate close to the fast Dunkerque-class battleships. These destroyers of 3,000 tons were all named after predators and had a maximum speed of 35.5 knots. Their armament comprised five 5.1-inch guns, two AA guns, two triple 21.7-inch torpedo tubes and four depth charge launchers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_453;The *Guépard-class* was a group of six large destroyers (contre-torpilleurs) of the French Navy, built during 1927–30. They were a slight improvement over the previous Chacal-class, featuring a larger hull and stronger armament. These destroyers had a maximum displacement of 3,220 tons and a top speed of 35.5 knots. They were armed with five 5.5-inch guns, four AA guns, two triple 21.7-inch torpedo tubes and two depth charge launchers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_454;The *Aigle-class* was a group of six large destroyers built for the French navy during 1931–34 as an enhancement of the previous Guépard-class. Their displacement was about the same (3,140 tons) but their high-pressure boilers provided a slightly higher top speed of 36 knots and weight savings that aided in the improvement of the operational range and armament. They were armed with five 5.5-inch guns, five AA guns, two triple 21.7-inch torpedo tubes and six depth charge launchers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_455;The *Vauquelin-class* was a series of six large destroyers built for the French Navy during 1931–34. Compared to the previous Aigle-class, they had almost the same maximum displacement of 3,170 tons, equal top speed of 36 knots but various modifications in armament. The main difference was the three triple torpedo tubes (as opposed to two) and the ability to carry mines. Other differences were a heavier AA battery of five guns and more modern main guns of 5.4-inch caliber.
$LoadingScreens_Text_456;*Le Fantasque class* was a group of six large destroyers built during 1931–34 for the French Navy. They were intended to closely support the main fleet of French battleships, utilizing their powerful armament, large operational range and exceptional speed. These ships of 3,300 to 3,500 tons achieved 45 knots in the original design and 37 knots after their heavy AA guns were refitted. Their main armament comprised three triple torpedo tubes and five 5.4-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_457;*Mogador-class* was a series of two large destroyers of the French Navy built during 1935–39. These very large destroyers of 4,000 tons were designed to closely support the fast Dunkerque battleships, so along with their sufficient operational range they had a remarkable top speed of 39 knots. They were essentially an improved version of Le Fantasque class, featuring a more efficient main battery of four twin 5.4-inch guns, two twin and two triple torpedo tubes, as well as multiple depth charges and mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_458;*USS Maine (ACR-1)* was an armored cruiser of the US Navy that was built in response to the Brazilian battleship Riachuelo and the increase of naval forces in Latin America. Maine was out of date by the time she entered service due to the prolonged construction period that lasted from 1888 to 1895. She had a displacement of 6,789 tons, a main armament of two twin 10-inch guns and 28 guns of smaller caliber. Her maximum speed was 16.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_459;*USS Maine (ACR-1)* was an armored cruiser of the US Navy that was sunk in Havana Harbor during the Cuban revolt against Spain on 15 February 1898. The cause of Maine’s sudden explosion which resulted in the loss of most of her crew remains unclear. However, this event ignited a major political conflict between the USA and Spain and huge protests of American Citizens asking for retaliation. Eventually, the sinking of Maine became one of the reasons that led to the Spanish-American War a few months later.
$LoadingScreens_Text_46;*Hull Form* affects the ship's acceleration, turning speed and the engine power needed to achieve top speed. Additionally, it affects the speed penalty from structural damage. Hull Form effects can be modified by ship design.
$LoadingScreens_Text_460;*USS Texas* was classified as a battleship but was basically a modified version of her sister ship, the armored cruiser USS Maine, featuring a larger main battery of two twin 12-inch guns and a higher speed of 17.8 knots. Texas was built during 1889–1892 as a response to the increase of Latin American naval forces. Due to the several mishaps during her construction she was considered an unlucky ship but her reputation was improved after her successful participation in the Spanish–American War.
$LoadingScreens_Text_461;After the explosion of the *armored cruiser USS Maine* in Havana harbor on February 15, 1898, several satirical drawings were published in the US related to this incident. One characteristic example is the cartoon image with title “Unlucky 13” showing the Spanish King Alphonso XIII playing with toy boats in Cuba while he is about to suffer “Retribution”.
$LoadingScreens_Text_462;*USS New York* is considered the second armored cruiser of the US Navy after USS Maine. She was built between 1890-1891 and was a ship that gratified the foreign standards of that time. With a maximum displacement of about 9,000 tons, New York had a main armament of six 8-inch guns supported by twenty-four guns of smaller caliber and four torpedo tubes. She had overall adequate armor protection with a thin belt armor of only 4-inches which, though, covered a wide area of the hull.
$LoadingScreens_Text_463;*USS Brooklyn* was the third armored cruiser of the US Navy and was built during 1893–1895 as an improvement of USS New York. Brooklyn had a larger displacement of about 10,000 tons and a much stronger armament of four twin 8-inch guns, twenty-eight smaller guns and five torpedo tubes. She was also a fast ship, able to reach almost 22 knots in her trials, but her armor protection was significantly light, so much that she could hardly be considered an armored cruiser.
$LoadingScreens_Text_464;The *Pennsylvania-class* was a group of six armored cruisers built during 1901–1908 for the United States Navy. Their initial armament was two twin 8-inch guns, supported by fourteen 6-inch guns, eighteen 3-inch guns, twelve 1.9-inch guns, two machine guns and two torpedo tubes. They were refitted two times over their long service which lasted till 1927, except USS California that was sunk during World War I. These ships of over 15,000 tons had a top speed of 22 knots but were moderately armored for their class.
$LoadingScreens_Text_465;The *Tennessee-class* was the last series of armored cruisers built for the United States Navy. Four of them were built during 1903–1906. Their heavy four twin 10-inch guns and the necessity to have a top speed of 22 knots sacrificed their armor, which was particularly light for their class. They were large ships of almost 16,000 tons that despite becoming obsolete versus the Battlecruisers, they remained in active service for a long time until 1946.
$LoadingScreens_Text_466;*Indiana-class* was the first battleship class of the US Navy, considering that the famous USS Maine was actually an armored cruiser that later was re-designated as a 2nd class battleship. The three ships of the class were built during 1893–1896 and had a displacement of about 10,500 tons and a top speed of only 15 knots. Their maneuverability was sacrificed for a heavy armament of two twin 13-inch guns and many large secondary guns as well as an ultra-thick armor protection that, though, covered a very narrow area of the hull.
$LoadingScreens_Text_467;The *USS Iowa* was the first sea going battleship of the US Navy and was built in an emergency program during 1896–1897 as an upgrade of the Indiana class battleships which were only suited for coastal duty due to their lower freeboard. Iowa had a bigger displacement of over 11,500 tons and could achieve a higher speed of 17 knots. The slightly lighter armament was better balanced in weight to aid the ship’s stability and consisted of two twin 12-inch guns, eight 8-inch guns and multiple other secondary guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_468;The *Kearsarge-class* was a group of two pre-dreadnought battleships built for the US Navy during 1896–1898. As the previous Indiana-class, USS Kearsarge and USS Kentucky were ships of low freeboard, designed to operate only for coastal defense. The main difference from the Indiana-class was the peculiar double-turret placement. Each one of the two 13-inch guns had stacked on top another twin turret of 8-inch guns. This gun arrangement was proven highly inefficient but was tried one more time later in Virginia-class battleships.
$LoadingScreens_Text_469;*USS Illinois* was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the US Navy during 1898–1901. The Illinois-class battleship had a displacement of nearly 12,500 tons and a top speed of 16 knots. She was armed with two twin 13-inch guns, supported by thirty-six guns of smaller caliber and four torpedo tubes. In 1909 the ship was refitted with cage masts and more modern equipment and later served mostly as a training ship and floating armory until she was scrapped in 1956.
$LoadingScreens_Text_47;The higher the *Stability* of the hull, the more accurate are the guns on high speed and bad weather. Stability is further affected by ship design.
$LoadingScreens_Text_470;The *Maine-class* was a series of three pre-dreadnought battleships built for the US Navy during 1899–1904. Maine, Missouri, and Ohio were the first US battleships that had Krupp cemented armor, water-tube boilers and other technological advances, that made them distinguish clearly from previous classes. They were ships of 13,900 tons, able to achieve 18 knots speed and were armed with two twin 12-inch guns, thirty smaller guns and two torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_471;The *Virginia-class* was a group of five pre-dreadnought battleships built for the US Navy during 1902-1907. These ships of about 16,500 tons adopted the unusual gun arrangement of the older Kearsarge-class, placing two of the 8-inch twin turrets atop of the 12-inch turrets. The guns proved to conflict with each other and could not fire independently, so this gun layout was never tried again in any ship. Nevertheless, the Virginias had a long and active service till 1920.
$LoadingScreens_Text_472;The *Connecticut-class* was a series of six pre-dreadnought battleships built for the US Navy during 1903–1908. These ships of 16,000 tons had a maximum speed of 18 knots and were armed with two twin 12-inch guns and a heavy secondary battery of 56 smaller guns. This mixed gun arrangement was considered vastly inferior compared to the all-big-gun standard of HMS Dreadnought, but this did not prevent the Connecticuts to sustain a long service till 1923.
$LoadingScreens_Text_473;The *Mississippi-class* was the last pre-dreadnought class designed by the US Navy. The class consisted of “Mississippi” and “Idaho” built during 1905–1908. Later these ships were modernized and sold to Greece in 1914 as part of the Greek naval arms race versus Ottoman Turkey. They were renamed “Kilkis'' and “Salamis” and became the most powerful ships of the Greek Navy. During World War II these ships were bombed and sunk by German Stuka dive bombers while they were stationed in Salamis port.
$LoadingScreens_Text_474;The *South-Carolina class* is considered the first dreadnought class of the US Navy and was composed by the ships “South Carolina” and “Michigan” built during 1908–1910. These battleships had a main armament of eight 12-inch guns mounted in four turrets, with two of them arranged in superfiring positions. Due to restrictions in US naval budget, their maximum displacement was limited to about 18,000 tons, reducing the space needed for machinery to increase their top speed, which was only 18.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_475;The *Delaware-class* was the second class of dreadnoughts of the United States Navy and was composed of the “Delaware” and “North Dakota” constructed during 1908–1910. Without the displacement constraints imposed by US Congress on the previous South Carolina class, these US battleships were the first to exceed 20,000 tons and were superior in all aspects. They were armed with five twin 12-inch guns, twenty smaller guns and two torpedo tubes, while they could reach the high speed of 21 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_476;The *Florida-class* was a pair of dreadnoughts built for the US Navy during 1909–1911. They were a bit larger from the previous Delaware-class but roughly similar, weighing about 23,000 tons and featuring the same arrangement of five twin 12-inch guns and a slightly stronger secondary battery. Both ships of the class, “Florida” and “Utah” were equipped with steam turbines which gave them good maneuverability and a top speed of 21 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_477;The *Wyoming-class* was the fourth generation of dreadnoughts for the US Navy. The two ships of the class, “Wyoming” and “Arkansas”, were built between 1910 and 1912 and had a noticeable improvement over the preceding Florida-class. These ships of over 27,000 tons had a top speed of 21 knots and were armed with six pairs of 12-inch guns supported by twenty-five smaller guns and two torpedo tubes. The Wyomings were the first American warships that utilized torpedo bulkheads.
$LoadingScreens_Text_478;The *New York class* consisted of USS New York and USS Texas had a rich service history. They were constructed during 1912–1914 and fought in both World Wars. In their initial version with the old-looking cage masts they displaced about 28,000 tons but after several enhancements they reached 33,000 tons and were transformed to fully modernized ships. When they were first commissioned they were distinguished for their powerful 14-inch guns arranged in five twin turrets. USS Texas is still in service as a Museum ship.
$LoadingScreens_Text_479;The *Nevada-class* was a pair of super dreadnoughts or “standard-type battleships” as otherwise termed by the US Navy. The two ships of the class, USS Nevada and USS Oklahoma were built between 1914–1916 and were the first to use triple gun turrets of 14-inch caliber. Among other technological advances, they used solely oil fuel instead of coal, geared steam turbines and the "All or Nothing" armor principle. Their displacement was nearly 30,000 tons and their top speed was 20.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_48;*Floatability* affects the impact of flooding on the hull. The higher this number, the less probable to get flooding after a hit and the less slow down due to flooding. Floatability effects may deteriorate by ship design.
$LoadingScreens_Text_480;The *Pennsylvania-class* consisted of two super-dreadnoughts built for the United States Navy during 1912–1916. USS Pennsylvania and USS Arizona were an incremental advance to the Nevada-class, with a larger displacement of nearly 32,000 tons and the same “All or Nothing” armor scheme that made them durable against long range plunging fire. These ships also featured geared steam turbines, oil fuel engines and triple turrets reaching the number of twelve 14-inch guns. Their maximum speed was about 21.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_481;The *New Mexico class* of three US Battleships was constructed during 1915–1919 and incorporated the technological concepts that were first introduced in the Nevada-class. “New Mexico”, “Idaho” and “Mississippi” featured the “All or Nothing” armor scheme, oil fuel engines and four triple 14-inch guns. All of them had geared steam turbines, except the lead ship of the class which was the first to use Electric-Drive propulsion. The New Mexico class was fully modernized and fought in World War II.
$LoadingScreens_Text_482;The *Tennessee-class* was a series of two battleships of the US Navy built shortly after World War I during 1916–1921. The class was represented by USS Tennessee and USS California which were essentially an improved version of the preceding New Mexico class. They were initially armed with four triple 14-inch guns, twenty-five 5-inch guns and two torpedo tubes. These ships survived the Pearl Harbor attack during World War II and were extensively rebuilt to exceed 41,000 tons in displacement.
$LoadingScreens_Text_483;The *Colorado-class* was a series of four US battleships laid down after World War I in 1917. Three ships were gradually completed until 1923: Colorado, Maryland, and West Virginia. The fourth, Washington, was canceled under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. The Colorado-class was the final group of the termed “standard-type battleships” of the US Navy, which shared common characteristics and was an improvement of the previous Tennessee-class, featuring a more powerful main battery of four twin 16-inch guns. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_484;The *North Carolina class* was a series of two battleships built for the US Navy during 1937–1941. USS North Carolina and USS Washington were constructed under the constraints of international naval treaties that significantly reduced the size of capital ships and “squeezed” their capabilities. Initially, these ships weighed 37,200 tons and were armed with three triple 16-inch guns and twenty 5-inch guns. At the outbreak of World War II, they were modified to displace over 45,000 tons to support stronger engines and multiple AA guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_485;The *South Dakota class* was a series of four battleships built during 1939–1942 for the United States Navy. The initial displacement of South Dakota, Indiana, Massachusetts, and Alabama was limited to 35,600 tons by naval treaties. They had the same armament with North Carolina class (three triple 16-inch guns), but were more compact, sturdier and slightly faster with 28.5 knots top speed. During World War II, they were modified to displace over 45,000 tons to support a stronger AA battery and longer operational range.
$LoadingScreens_Text_486;The *Iowa-class* represents the culmination of US battleship construction. Six ships were ordered in 1939 as a response to Japan’s noncompliance with the international naval treaties. Four ships were completed:  Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri, and Wisconsin under the 2nd London Naval Treaty which accepted an increased displacement of 45,700 tons. During World War II they were refitted to exceed 58,000 tons. Armed with three triple 16-inch guns, powerful AA guns and a top speed of 35 knots, they were unmatched by most warships of their time.
$LoadingScreens_Text_487;The *Chester-class* was a series of three cruisers that were initially designated as "scout cruisers" by the US Navy and after 1920 they were re-classified as light cruisers. They were built during 1905–1908 and were designed to support reconnaissance operations.  They had a maximum displacement of 4,687 tons and a top speed of 24 knots. Their light armament comprised two 5-inch guns, eight smaller guns and two torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_488;The *Omaha-class* was a series of ten light cruisers of the US Navy that were laid down after World War I in 1918 and were commissioned in 1923. Displacing about 7,000 tons, they were particularly fast with a top speed of 35 knots, as they were designed to screen the main fleet and support the destroyers. They were armed with two twin 6-inch guns, eight single 6-inch guns, three AA guns, a total of ten torpedo tubes and 224 mines. All cruisers fought in World War II and they were scrapped afterwards.
$LoadingScreens_Text_489;The *Brooklyn-class* was a series of seven light cruisers built during 1935–1938 for the US Navy. Several subsequent cruisers were based on this design such as the Baltimore and Cleveland classes. Satisfying the war treaties, they displaced about 10,000 tons but could reach 12,400 tons at full load. They were armed with five triple 6-inch guns, sixteen smaller guns and had a top speed of 34 knots. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_49;The *displacement* determines how many tons of machinery, armor, armament and other important equipment can be fitted. The more tonnage, the larger and more powerful the ship at the expense of becoming less maneuverable and bigger target.
$LoadingScreens_Text_490;The *St. Louis class* was a pair of light cruisers that were built during 1938–1939 for the US Navy. The two ships: St.Louis and Helena were mainly a modification of the preceding Brooklyn-class, incorporating improved protection for boilers and enhanced armament. At full load they exceeded their treaty displacement of 10,000 tons and reached 13,000 tons. They were armed with five triple 6-inch guns, eight 5-inch guns, a very strong AA battery and a depth charge track. Their top speed was 33 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_491;The *Atlanta-class* cruisers were eight light cruisers of about 6,700 tons that were initially designated as fast scout cruisers for the US Navy. Their construction started in 1940 and all of them were progressively completed in 1945. Their numerous dual-purpose guns made them very effective in their anti-aircraft role but the small caliber of the main battery (12x 5-inch guns) proved to be insufficient in surface combat, as “Atlanta” and “Juneau” were sunk in naval engagements of World War II.
$LoadingScreens_Text_492;The *Cleveland-class* was the most numerous series of light cruisers ever built for the US Navy. 27 ships of this famous class were completed during World War II and post-war while some have been modified to aircraft carriers or other vessels. The Clevelands had a maximum displacement of 14,358 tons and a top speed of 32.5 knots. Their main armament was four triple 6-inch guns, six dual purpose 5-inch guns and a massive battery of up to 38 AA guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_493;The two *Pensacola-class* cruisers were the first “Treaty Cruisers” of the US Navy. They were built during 1929–1930 and satisfied the Washington Naval Treaty with a displacement of 9.246 tons which could reach almost 11,700 tons at full load. Their top speed was 32.5 knots and their main armament consisted of two triple and two double 8-inch guns supported by six torpedo tubes. The anti-aircraft armament was especially heavy, featuring more than 56x AA turrets of various calibers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_494;The *Northampton-class* was a group of six heavy cruisers built for the US Navy between 1928 and 1931. Faithful to the Washington Naval Treaty they had a displacement of about 10,000 tons and possessed sufficient firepower and speed at the expense of smaller armor and torpedo protection. They were armed with three triple 8-inch guns, six torpedo tubes and 52x AA turrets while their maximum speed was 32.5 knots. These ships saw a lot of action during World War II and three of them were sunk.
$LoadingScreens_Text_495;The *Portland-class* was a pair of heavy cruisers constructed for the US Navy between 1930 and 1933 under the constraints of the Washington Naval Treaty. Their displacement was almost 10,000 tons and they had a top speed of 32.7 knots. They were armed with three triple 8-inch guns and had a powerful anti-aircraft battery. USS Portland fought and survived in World War II, while her sister ship, USS Indianapolis, was sunk by a Japanese submarine in 1945, leading to the biggest loss of life at sea, from a single ship, in the history of the US Navy.
$LoadingScreens_Text_496;The *New Orleans-class* cruisers were a series of seven heavy cruisers built for the US Navy during 1931–1937. As treaty cruisers their standard displacement did not exceed 10,000 tons, although at full load they could reach almost 12,500 tons. They were actually very similar to previous cruiser designs featuring a main armament of three triple 8-inch guns, a strong AA battery and a top speed of 32.7 knots. All ships had a very active service during World War II and three of them were sunk in battle.
$LoadingScreens_Text_497;*USS Wichita* was a heavy cruiser of the US Navy that was built during 1937–1939. She was originally intended to follow the New Orleans-class design but eventually her hull was enlarged to meet the newer London Naval Treaty that permitted a bigger size of cruisers. At full load she exceeded 13,000 tons, allowing a thicker armor protection and strong engines that could achieve 33 knots speed. Her armament consisted of three triple 8-inch guns, eight dual purpose 5-inch guns and a powerful AA battery.
$LoadingScreens_Text_498;The *Baltimore-class* is the most numerous class of heavy cruisers ever built for the US Navy. 14 ships were completed throughout World War II, under no treaty limitations. With a displacement of more than 17,000 tons, the Baltimores had sufficient armor protection and hosted a heavy armament of three triple 8-inch guns, six dual 5-inch guns and an ultra-heavy AA battery. Their primary role was to escort the US aircraft carriers, although many times they used their main guns for naval bombardments.
$LoadingScreens_Text_499;The *Lexington-class* was the only Battlecruiser class ordered by the US Navy. It was requested in 1911 as a reaction to the Japanese Kongō-class battlecruiser but was never completed due to political considerations and increased naval expenditures of that period. The final design was intended to have four twin 16-inch guns and support a top speed of 33 knots. Eventually, only two of the six programmed ships were continued and were converted to the aircraft carriers USS-Lexington and USS-Saratoga.

$LoadingScreens_Text_50;Each object you mount on a ship, increases its size signature, making it more *detectable and a bigger target*.
$LoadingScreens_Text_500;The *Alaska-class* was a pair of cruisers that were built during World War II for the US Navy. USS-Alaska and USS-Guam were designated as large cruisers (CB) although many considered them the first realized battlecruiser project of the United States. At nearly 35,000 tons they could travel at a speed of 33 knots and were armed with three triple 12-inch guns, twelve dual purpose 5-inch guns and a massive AA battery.
$LoadingScreens_Text_501;The *Cincinnati-class* consisted of two protected cruisers built during 1890–1894 for the US Navy. These small cruisers of nearly 3,400 tons were designed for commerce raiding and had a maximum speed of 19 knots. They were armed with one 6-inch gun, five 5-inch guns, eleven smaller guns and four torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_502;The *Montgomery-class* was represented by three cruisers of 2,000 tons built during 1890–1894 for the US Navy. They had sufficient armament but were practically unarmored as they were designed for peacetime duty and not to act offensively versus other cruisers. Nevertheless, they participated in shore bombardment in the Spanish-American War.
$LoadingScreens_Text_503;The *Columbia-class* was a pair of protected cruisers built during 1890–1894 for the US Navy. They were ships of about 7,500 tons that could travel at a maximum speed of 22.5 knots. They were armed with one 8-inch gun, two 6-inch guns, twenty other smaller guns and four torpedo tubes. The Columbias were lightly armored but were especially fast for their time plus they had a very large operational range.
$LoadingScreens_Text_504;The *Denver-class* was a group of six protected cruisers built during 1900–1905 for the US Navy that were designed for peacetime patrol duties in overseas areas. Due to their limited role, they were very lightly armored and had a rather weak armament of ten five-inch guns and ten smaller guns. Their displacement was 3,251 tons and their top speed did not exceed 16,5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_505;The *St. Louis-class* was a group of three protected cruisers built for the US Navy during 1902–1906. This class was rather unique as the ships were large as armoured cruisers with a displacement reaching 11,000 tons but their armour and armament were light, using the saved weight for extra engine machinery and operational range. This is why they were called “Semi-Armoured Cruisers''. They had a designed top speed of 22 knots and were armed with a numerous battery of fourteen 6-inch guns and forty-four smaller guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_506;*USS Cushing* was the first torpedo boat of the United States Navy and was completed in 1890. This small vessel of 107 tons had a top speed of 23 knots and a quite formidable armament of three 2.2-inch guns and three 18-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_507;*USS Ericsson* was the second torpedo boat of the US Navy. It was built between 1892 and 1894 and commissioned in 1897, seven years after the first torpedo boat USS Cushing. This vessel of 107 tons had a top speed of 24 knots and was armed with four 1.46-inch guns and three 18-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_508;The *Foote-class* was a group of three torpedo boats produced for the US Navy between 1896 and 1897. These vessels of about 147 tons carried up to three 18-inch torpedo tubes and had an additional armament of three 1.46-inch guns. Their top speed was 25 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_509;The *Porter-class* was a group of two torpedo boats of the US Navy that fought in the Spanish-American War. USS Porter and USS Du Pont were constructed in 1896 and had a displacement of 168 tons. Their engine of 3,200 hp provided a top speed of 29 knots. Their armament consisted of four 1.46-inch guns and three torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_51;The *Main Tower* is an integral part of the ship and must exist in all designs. Towers enhance visibility, accuracy and damage control. Smoke from funnels may obstruct visibility and reduce their effects.
$LoadingScreens_Text_510;*USS Rowan* was a torpedo boat built between 1898–1899 for the US Navy. This vessel of 213 tons participated in the Spanish-American War and was armed with four 1.46-inch guns and three torpedo tubes. The engine of 3,200 hp provided a top speed of 26 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_511;*USS Dahlgren* and *USS Craven* were respectively the 9th and 10th torpedo boats constructed for the US Navy. They were completed in 1900 and had a displacement of 148 tons. Being rather small and equipped with an engine of 4,200 hp they were able to reach the speed of 31 knots. They were armed with two torpedo tubes and four 1.46-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_512;The first *Farragut* was a torpedo boat built for the US Navy between 1898–1899. This torpedo boat had a displacement of 283 tons and a top speed of 30 knots. The armament comprised four 2.24-inch guns and two 18-inch torpedo tubes. Farragut had a quite long military service which continued even after World War I.
$LoadingScreens_Text_513;The *Davis-Class* was a pair of small torpedo boats built during 1898–1899. USS Davis and USS Fox were the 12th and 13th torpedo boats constructed for the US Navy and weighed 156 tons. Their top speed was rather low at 23 knots, due to their 1700 hp engine which was quite small for their size. They were armed with three torpedo tubes and three 1.46-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_514;*USS Morris* was the 14th torpedo boat of the US Navy and was constructed between 1897-1898. With a displacement of only 107 tons, it carried an engine big enough to provide a top speed of 23 knots. The armament comprised three 1.46-inch guns and three 18-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_515;The *Talbot-class* of torpedo boats consisted of two vessels and was built during 1897–1898. USS Talbot and USS Gwin were very small, as they displaced only 47 tons. With that small size, they were only suited for coast patrol duty. Their maximum speed was 21 knots and were armed with one 1.46-inch gun and two 18-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_516;The *MacKenzie-class* was built during 1898–1899 for the US Navy. USS MacKenzie and USS McKee were the last US torpedo boats of very small size. Afterwards, all other classes constructed were significantly larger. These vessels had a displacement of only 66 tons and a top speed of 20 knots. They were armed with one 1.46-inch gun and two 18-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_517;*USS Stringham* was the 19th torpedo boat of the US Navy, laid down in 1899 and commissioned in 1905. With a displacement of 345 tons it carried strong engines that provided a high speed of 30 knots. Four 2.24-inch guns and two 18-inch torpedo tubes comprised the armament.
$LoadingScreens_Text_518;*USS Goldsborough* was the 20th torpedo boat of the US Navy, laid down in 1899 and commissioned in 1908. This torpedo boat had a displacement of 259 tons and a top speed of 26 knots. It was armed with the typical set of four 2.24-inch guns and two 18-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_519;The *Blakely-class* was a numerous class of nine torpedo boats of the US Navy, produced during 1900-1913. Their displacement varied between 160 and 220 tons and their top speed reached 26 knots. Their standard armament was two to three torpedo tubes and two to three small guns of 1.45-inch caliber. After this class, the US torpedo boats became larger and belonged to the “torpedo boat destroyer” type.
$LoadingScreens_Text_52;The *Secondary tower* is needed in most ship types and is an additional supportive element of the main tower. Usually, the secondary towers suffer more from funnel smoke obstruction, unless they are tall enough.
$LoadingScreens_Text_520;The *Bainbridge-class* was the first Destroyer class of the US Navy. 13 ships were built during 1899–1903 and were originally designated as “Torpedo Boat Destroyers (TBD)”. With a maximum displacement of about 640 tons they were almost twice bigger than previous torpedo boats, allowing them to carry extra machinery and heavier weaponry. They were armed with two 3-inch guns, five 2.2-inch guns and two torpedo tubes, while their top speed was 29 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_521;The *Truxtun-class* was a group of three Torpedo Boat Destroyers built during 1899–1902, which were among the first 16 Destroyers of the US Navy, constructed at the same time with the Bainbridge-class. These ships had a maximum displacement of 615 tons and their 8,300 hp engine provided a top speed of 30 knots. Their armament consisted of two 3-inch guns, five 2.2-inch guns and two torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_522;The *Smith-class* was a group of five Destroyers built during 1908–1910. They are considered the first truly seagoing Destroyers of the US Navy, due to their high forecastle and long operational range. They were also the first turbine-powered Destroyers in US Service. These ships of about 900 tons had a top speed of 28 knots and were armed with five 3-inch guns and three torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_523;The *Paulding-class* was a non-uniform series of 21 Destroyers built during 1908–1910 as an improvement of Smith-class. They had about the same displacement of 900 tons but their oil fired boilers provided weight savings which allowed a stronger engine, more torpedo tubes and greater range.  Their top speed was 29.5 knots while they were armed with five 3-inch guns and three twin torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_524;The *Cassin-class* was a series of four destroyers built for the US Navy during 1912–1915. They were called “thousand tonners” due to their large normal displacement of about 1,000 tons and all previous Destroyer classes became known as “flivvers” for their smaller size. Their strong turbine-powered engines of 16,000 shp provided a top speed of 29 knots. Their armament consisted of four 4-inch guns and four twin 18-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_525;The *Aylwin-class* of US Destroyers consisted of four ships that were built during 1912–14. In terms of size and armament, they had a very similar design with Cassin-class, as they belonged to the first “thousand tonners” Destroyers that were approved for construction by the US Congress a few years before the First World War. Their top speed was 29.5 knots and their armament comprised four 4-inch guns and four twin 18-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_526;The *O'Brien-class* was the third group of destroyers built for the US Navy shortly before World War I, known as “thousand tonners”. Six ships belonged to this class that had a displacement of about 1,000 tons and a top speed of 29 knots. They shared the standard armament of previous classes (four 4-inch guns and four twin torpedo tubes) but their torpedoes were larger, 21-inch instead of 18-inch, thus they had significantly more firepower.
$LoadingScreens_Text_527;The *Tucker-class* was the fourth group of the so-called  “thousand tonners” US destroyers and was built during 1914–1916. All these ships shared similar characteristics with slight improvements for every newer version. Compared to the previous O'Brien-class, the Tucker-class had the same armament (four 4-inch guns and four 21-inch twin torpedo tubes), slightly higher speed of 29.5 knots and all of them utilized geared steam turbines, which made their engines much more efficient.
$LoadingScreens_Text_528;The *Sampson-class* was the last “thousand tonners” group of US Destroyers. Six ships were built between 1915–1917, during World War I and were a significant improvement over the previous classes. They were larger with a maximum displacement of over 1,200 tons and while carrying the typical gun arrangement of four 4-inch guns they featured an upgraded torpedo armament of four triple 21-inch tubes. They were also the first US Destroyers equipped with ASW armament (one depth charge) and AA guns (two 1.3-inch).
$LoadingScreens_Text_529;The *Caldwell-class* was the first group of US Destroyers known as “Flush-deckers”, that came as an improvement of previous Destroyers with a very high and vulnerable forecastle. The first ships started to be built shortly before the United States entered World War I and were completed between 1916–1920. With a maximum displacement of about 1,100 tons, they all carried the standard armament of four 4-inch guns and four triple 21-inch torpedo tubes, while their top speed was between 30 and 32 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_53;At least one *Funnel* is needed for the proper operation of the ship engine. More funnels improve steam efficiency and thus boost the engine and boiler performance, meaning more speed and acceleration power.
$LoadingScreens_Text_530;The *Wickes-class* was a large series of 111 destroyers built during 1917–1921 for the US Navy. They belonged to the “Flush-deckers” group of US destroyers which had a high freeboard and improved sea worthiness, compared to older classes. Their maximum displacement reached 1,250 tons and their top speed could exceed 35 knots. Their main armament consisted of four 4-inch guns and four triple 21-inch torpedo tubes. All of them had a long active service till the end of World War II.
$LoadingScreens_Text_531;The *Clemson-class* was the last “Flush-deckers” series of US Destroyers. A total of 156 ships were built during 1918–1922 as an improvement of Wickes-class featuring a longer operational range, due to their increased fuel capacity. Weighing about 1,300 tons, they had a top speed of 35.5 knots and carried the typical armament for US Destroyers of that time: four 4-inch guns, four triple 21-inch torpedo tubes and 1x AA gun.
$LoadingScreens_Text_532;The *Farragut-class* was the first Post World War I design of US Destroyers. Eight ships were built during 1932–1935 under the 1,500 ton limit of the London Naval Treaty. The Farraguts had a standard displacement of 1,365 tons and accomplished an impressive top speed of 37 knots. They had a large operational range and were initially armed with five dual-purpose 5-inch guns, two quad torpedo tubes and four AA guns. In World War II they were refitted to include more AA guns and their displacement became over 2,000 tons at full load.
$LoadingScreens_Text_533;The *Porter-class* was a series of eight Destroyers of the US Navy, built during 1932–35. They had a standard displacement of 1,850 tons, as imposed by the London Naval Treaty and they were intended to function as “Destroyer Leaders”. They had a top speed of 37 knots and their armament included four twin 5-inch guns, four AA guns and two quad torpedo tubes. In World War II they were refitted to host more AA guns and depth charges while their maximum displacement exceeded 2,000 tons.
$LoadingScreens_Text_534;The *Mahan-class* was a series of 1,500-ton Destroyers of the US Navy. Eighteen ships were built during 1934–37 as improvements of the Farragut-class. They had the same gun armament of five 5-inch guns and an equal top speed of 37 knots, but had more torpedo tubes (three quad launchers) and longer operational range. In World War II they were refitted with enhanced armament and their displacement exceeded 2,100 tons.
$LoadingScreens_Text_535;The *Gridley-class* was a group of four destroyers built during 1935–38 for the US Navy. Their standard displacement satisfied almost exactly the 1,500-ton limit of the London Naval Treaty. Compared to the previous Mahan-class, they had four 5-inch guns sacrificing one gun for an extra torpedo launcher, increasing the number to four quad torpedo tubes. These newer ships also had an exceptional top speed of 38.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_536;The *Bagley-class* belonged to the 1,500-ton group of destroyers built for the US Navy under the London Naval Treaty. Eight ships were built during 1935–37 and shared similar characteristics with the Gridley and Benham class. Their initial armament comprised four dual purpose 5-inch guns, four quad torpedo tubes and four AA guns. All these Destroyers became upgraded during World War II with their displacement becoming increasing to over 2,200 tons.
$LoadingScreens_Text_537;The *Somers-class* was a group of five Destroyer Leaders, built during 1935–39 for the US Navy as an answer to the increasingly bigger Japanese Destroyers. Their standard displacement of 1,840 tons satisfied the London Naval Treaty but during World War II they were upgraded and exceeded the 2,700 tons. Their top speed was 36 knots and they were initially armed with four twin 5-inch guns, three quad torpedo tubes, four AA guns and two depth charge racks.
$LoadingScreens_Text_538;The *Benham-class* was the last series of 1,500-ton destroyers of the US Navy, which were designed under the limitations of the London Naval Treaty. They were built during 1936–39 and as World War II escalated they became refitted to use their full load displacement which eventually reached 2,250 tons. Similarly to other 1,500-tonners, they were initially armed with four quad torpedo tubes, four 5-inch guns and four light AA guns while their top speed was 37 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_539;The *Sims-class* was a series of twelve Destroyers, built between 1937 and 1940 for the US Navy. These US Destroyers were the first built without ship displacement limits of Naval Treaties but eventually they did not come up particularly larger than previous treaty Destroyers, weighing 1,570 tons at minimum load. Their top speed was 37 knots and were initially armed with five 5-inch guns, three quad torpedo tubes and four light AA guns. This armament was later modified to include many more AA guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_54;The *Funnel capacity* is a statistic depended from the funnels and expresses the maximum engine horsepower that the boiler system can support. If the engine is not adequately supported, then steam efficiency is reduced and penalties apply to ship speed and acceleration.
$LoadingScreens_Text_540;The *Fletcher-class* was the last US Destroyer class that was designed prior to World War II under no treaty limitations. A total of 175 ships were completed during the war and many of them were exported to other countries in the 1950s. The Fletchers had a maximum displacement of about 2,500 tons and were armed with five 5-inch guns, up to 22x AA guns, two quintuple torpedo tubes and multiple depth charge racks. Their 60,000 shp engines provided a top speed of 36.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_541;The *Monarch-class* represented the biggest warship class of Austria-Hungary in the early 1890s. Three ships were built during 1893–1896 that were designated as coastal defense ships, due to their low freeboard and small operational range. They could be considered armored cruisers since they had very thick armor protection and a heavy main armament of two twin 9-inch guns. Their displacement was about 5,800 tons and their top speed was 15.5 knots except SMS Wien which had stronger engines and could reach 17.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_542;The *Habsburg-class* were the first ocean-going battleships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, which however resembled more to armored cruisers, compared to other major power navies. Three ships were built during 1899–1903 that had a displacement of about 8,965 tons and a top speed of 19 knots. Their main armament consisted of one forward twin turret and one aft single turret of 9.4-inch guns. They had a strong secondary armament of twelve 5.9-inch guns and eighteen smaller guns supported by two submerged 17.7-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_543;The *Erzherzog Karl-class* was the second series of pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Three ships were constructed during 1902–1907 and when completed they were considered outdated compared to the larger dreadnoughts of other powers. They had a displacement of 10,640 tons and their top speed was 20.5 knots. Two twin 9.4-inch guns were their main armament, supported by a sheer number of secondary guns of various caliber and two submerged torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_544;The *Radetzky-class* was the third and last pre-dreadnought series of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The three ships of the class that were built during 1908–1911 were considered semi-dreadnoughts due to their large number of big guns that were not uniform in caliber. Their main armament was two twin 12-inch guns and four twin 9.4-inch guns, supported by twenty-six smaller secondary guns. With these ships of about 16,000 tons and 20.5 knots top speed, the Austro-Hungarian Navy made a big step forward in the naval arms race but continued to be much behind compared to other powers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_545;The *Tegetthoff-class* (or Viribus Unitis-class) was the first and last dreadnought series of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The four ships of the class, composed of SMS Viribus Unitis, SMS Tegetthoff, SMS Prinz Eugen, and SMS Szent István were built during 1910–1914. They had a total displacement of 21,346 tons, a top speed of 20 knots and were armed with twelve 12-inch guns mounted in four triple turrets. These powerful ships were among the first in the world that featured triple main guns, and represented the peak of Austria-Hungary’s naval development before her defeat in World War I. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_546;*SMS Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia* was the first armored cruiser of the Austro-Hungarian Navy and was built during 1891–1893. She had a maximum displacement of 6,123 tons and a top speed of 19.35 knots. The armament comprised two twin 9.5-inch guns, eight 5.9-inch guns, twenty guns of smaller caliber and four underwater 18-inch torpedo tubes. Her armor had a thickness between 2.0 and 3.9 inches.
$LoadingScreens_Text_547;*SMS Kaiser Karl VI* represented the second series of armored cruisers for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Three ships belonged to this class and all of them were built between 1896–1898. They had a maximum displacement of 6,974 tons and were armed with a main battery of two twin 9.5-inch guns. These cruisers were additionally armed with eight 5.9-inch guns, twenty smaller guns and two 18-inch underwater torpedo tubes. Their top speed was nearly 21 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_548;*SMS Sankt Georg* was the third and final armored cruiser class of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. She was built during 1901–1903 as an improvement of the previous cruiser “Kaiser Karl VI” and had a maximum displacement of 8,200 tons. The armament comprised two twin 9.5-inch guns, five 7.5-inch guns, thirty other guns of mixed caliber and two 18-inch torpedo tubes. She had a top speed of 22 knots and armor that reached 8 inches in thickness.
$LoadingScreens_Text_549;The *Kaiser Franz Joseph I* was a class of two protected cruisers built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy during 1888–1890. They had a maximum displacement of 4,954 tons and were heavily armed for their class. They had a main battery of two 9.5-inch guns, supported by six 5.9-inch guns, sixteen smaller guns and two torpedo tubes. Their speed could reach 20 knots. As all protected cruisers of that time, they had no belt armor but armor covered other ship sections with thickness up to 3.5 inches.
$LoadingScreens_Text_55;*Funnels emit smoke* that obstructs visibility and reduces gun accuracy. High towers reduce this negative effect. Rear towers usually suffer more from smoke obstruction, unless they are tall enough.
$LoadingScreens_Text_550;The *Zenta-class* was a series of three protected cruisers built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy during 1896–1899. They displaced about 2,500 tons and had a top speed of 20.8 knots. Their armament consisted of eight 4.7-inch guns, ten 1.9-inch guns, two machine guns and two torpedo tubes, mounted above water. The armor protection ranged in thickness from one to two inches.
$LoadingScreens_Text_551;*SMS Admiral Spaun* was the first ship of the Austro-Hungarian Navy that featured steam turbines and was built during 1908–1909. With a displacement of 4,000 tons she was designated as a scout cruiser and could reach the high speed of 27 knots. Her armament was light and included seven 3.9-inch guns, one AA gun, one 1.9-inch gun and two torpedo tubes. The armor protection scheme was also light and had a maximum 2.4 inches thickness at the belt.
$LoadingScreens_Text_552;The *Kaiman-class* were twenty-four seagoing torpedo boats of the Austro-Hungarian Navy that were constructed between 1904 and 1910. They displaced about 210 tons and their 3,000 hp engine provided a top speed of 26 knots. Their armament consisted of four 1.9-inch guns and three torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_553;The *Tatra-class* was a series of six destroyers built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy shortly before World War I. They were ships of about 1,000 tons and had a top speed of 32.5 knots. They were armed with two 3.9-inch guns, six 2.6-inch guns and two twin 18-inch torpedo tubes. Two of them were sunk during the war. After the war, three vessels were ceded to Italy, and one to France.
$LoadingScreens_Text_554;The *Huszár-class* was a series of fourteen destroyers built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The first ship was designed and constructed by the British “Yarrow Shipbuilders” and the rest were built in Austro-Hungarian shipyards between 1905 and 1909. They were small craft of about 420 tons, so they could be more accurately described as torpedo boats. Their top speed was 28 knots and were armed with one 2.6-inch gun, seven 1.9-inch guns and two torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_555;The *Fuji-class* was the first pre-dreadnought class of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Two ships of about 12,500 tons were built during 1894–1897 in British facilities. Their design was based on the Royal-Sovereign class and although they displaced less tons, they had more advanced weaponry and stronger Harvey armor. Their top speed was 18 knots and were armed with two twin 12-inch guns, ten 6-inch guns, twenty-four small caliber guns and five underwater torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_556;The *Shikishima-class* was the second pre-dreadnought class of the Imperial Japanese Navy and consisted of two ships that were designed and built during 1898–1901 in British shipyards. Their displacement was about 15,200 tons and were armed with two twin 12-inch guns, fourteen 6-inch guns, thirty-two smaller guns and four underwater torpedo tubes. Their top speed was 18 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_557;The *Asahi-class* was the third pre-dreadnought class of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The sole ship of its class was built during 1897–1900 in British shipyards, as all previous Japanese battleships, because Japan lacked the necessary industrial facilities during that period. Asahi had a very similar design to the Shikishima-class, featuring the same displacement of 15,200 tons and main armament of two twin 12-inch guns. Their main visual difference was that Asahi had two big funnels instead of three smaller ones.
$LoadingScreens_Text_558;The *Mikasa-class* was the fourth and most well known pre-dreadnought class of the Imperial Japanese Navy. She was designed and built in British shipyards as a modified Formidable-class and became the flagship of Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō during the Russo-Japanese War. Mikasa was similar to earlier Shikishima and Asahi classes made in Britain, with the main difference being the much stronger Krupp armor scheme. She had a displacement of about 15,300 tons, a top speed of 18 knots and was armed with two twin 12-inch guns, fourteen QF 6-inch guns, thirty-two smaller guns and four torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_559;The *Katori-class* were the last pre-dreadnought battleships built in overseas shipyards for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Two ships of this class were constructed in Britain during 1904–1906 and were delivered after the end of the Russo-Japanese War. They could be considered “Semi-Dreadnoughts” due to their mixed large caliber guns. They were armed with two twin 12-inch guns, four single 10-inch guns, up to nineteen small caliber guns and five torpedo tubes. Their top speed was 18 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_56;As it happened historically, the *big guns* (9-inch and higher) cause tremendous damage according to their caliber. So it is usually a good practice to maximize the caliber of the ship’s main guns, if the technology allows it.
$LoadingScreens_Text_560;*Satsuma* was the first Japanese battleship built in Japan and was the sole ship of her class. She was constructed during 1905–1906 and had a displacement of over 20,000 tons and a top speed of 18 knots. Satsuma was typically a “Semi-Dreadnought” due to the mixed main armament of two twin 12-inch and six twin 10-inch guns. She was also armed with twenty secondaries (4.7-inch and 3-inch guns) and five torpedo tubes. Satsuma was the largest battleship in the world at the time of her launching but she was very soon shadowed by HMS Dreadnought that was completed and commissioned the same year.
$LoadingScreens_Text_561;The *Kawachi-class* is considered the first dreadnought series for the Imperial Japanese Navy. The two ships of the class, “Kawachi” and “Settsu” were built during 1909–1912 and had a long service till 1945 after multiple refits. They had a displacement of about 21,800 tons and a top speed of 21 knots that was achieved by their turbine powered engines. They were armed with a total of six twin 12-inch guns, but those used in the wing turrets were slightly shorter in length. This fact created a rather mixed ballistics system, which deteriorated the main gun accuracy.
$LoadingScreens_Text_562;The *Fusō-class* was the second dreadnought series for the Imperial Japanese Navy. The two ships of the class, “Fusō” and “Yamashiro” were built during World War I and were completed in 1917. They were especially long ships with six twin 14-inch gun turrets and their displacement reached 29,800 tons. Their armament was supported by sixteen 6-inch guns, five 5-inch guns and six torpedo tubes. Both ships became fully modernized in the 1930s and received the characteristic “pagoda” style towers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_563;Most old battleships of the Imperial Japanese Navy were reconstructed and had very long active service, instead of being scuttled. A characteristic example is the battleship *Fusō* which became modernized during the 1930s and enlarged, reaching 35,300 tons of displacement. The new “pagoda” style towers carried multiple sensor and fire control systems as well as many Anti-Aircraft guns. A total of 95 Anti-Aircraft guns, three float planes and many tons of extra equipment and machinery were mounted on ship, resulting in the removal of some secondary guns and torpedo tubes to save weight.
$LoadingScreens_Text_564;The *Ise-class* was a pair of dreadnoughts built for the Imperial Japanese Navy during 1915–1918 as an improvement of Fusō-class. They had a displacement of 31,760 tons and could achieve a top speed of 23 knots. Initially, they were armed with six twin 14-inch guns, twenty 5.5-inch guns, four AA guns and five torpedo tubes. In the 1930s these ships received a major modernization and during World War II they were converted to hybrid carriers, able to carry up to 22 aircraft.
$LoadingScreens_Text_565;The *Nagato-class* was a pair of battleships that could be termed “Super Dreadnoughts”. The two ships of the class, “Nagato” and “Mutsu” were constructed during 1917–21 improving the preceding Ise-Class. They had a displacement of 32,720 tons and their 80,000 shp engine provided a top speed of 26 knots. Their main armament consisted of four twin 16.1-inch guns, which were considered very powerful at that time period. The Nagato-class became modernized and served till the end of World War II.
$LoadingScreens_Text_566;The *Tosa-class* battleships started to be constructed in 1921 and were intended to be larger versions of the preceding Nagato class, carrying an additional 16.1-inch twin-gun turret. Due to the Washington Naval Treaty the first ship “Tosa” was cancelled and scuttled, while the second “Kaga” was converted to an aircraft carrier and later served in World War II.
$LoadingScreens_Text_567;The *Yamato-class* battleships of the Imperial Japanese Navy were the heaviest and most powerful battleships ever built. They had a maximum displacement of 73,000 tons and were armed with the biggest guns ever used in a ship, three triple 18.1-inch guns. Their construction began in 1937 at a time when Japan had withdrawn from the Washington Naval Treaty and had no restrictions in warship building. From the five ships ordered, two ships were completed during World War II (Yamato and Musashi) and a third (Shinano) was converted to an aircraft carrier.
$LoadingScreens_Text_568;The *Asama-class* was the first armored cruiser series of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The two ships of the class, “Asama” and “Tokiwa” were built during 1896–1899 in British shipyards and had a displacement of about 9,700 tons. They were armed with two twin 8-inch guns, fourteen 6-inch guns, twelve 3-inch guns, eight 1.85-inch guns and five underwater torpedo tubes. They could travel at 21 knots and had quite strong armor protection that reached 7-inches thickness at the belt.
$LoadingScreens_Text_569;The *Izumo-class* was an armored cruiser series built for the Imperial Japanese Navy during 1898–1901. Two ships of about 9,500 tons were constructed  in British shipyards. They were armed with two twin 8-inch guns, fourteen 6-inch guns, twelve 3-inch guns, eight 1.65-inch guns and four underwater torpedo tubes. Their designed top speed was 20.75 knots but on trials they proved faster by at least one knot.
$LoadingScreens_Text_57;*Small guns* (2-inch up to 8-inch) are no match against big guns but should not be underestimated. Their high fire rate can quickly disable a ship if it stays in their range for long and they are very effective against torpedo boats.
$LoadingScreens_Text_570;*Yakumo* was a foreign-built armored cruiser of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The ship was constructed in Germany during 1899–1900 at a time when Japan lacked the industrial facilities to build her own warships. Yakumo had a displacement of about 9,500 tons and was armed with  two twin 8-inch guns, twelve 6-inch guns, twelve 3-inch guns, eight 1.65-inch guns and five underwater torpedo tubes. Yakumo’s top speed was 20 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_571;*Azuma* was an armored cruiser of the Imperial Japanese Navy built in France during 1899–1900. This ship and others belonged to a major naval construction programme executed in foreign countries, as Japan lacked the industrial facilities to build large warships at that time. Azuma had a displacement of about 9,300 tons and a top speed of 21 knots. The armament comprised two twin 8-inch guns, twelve 6-inch guns, twelve 3-inch guns, eight 1.85-inch guns and five torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_572;The *Kasuga-class* of the Imperial Japanese Navy consisted of two ships that were originally ordered by the Argentinian navy but eventually they were sold to Japan. “Kasuga” and “Nisshin” were based on the successful design of the Giuseppe Garibaldi-class. They were constructed during 1902–1904 in Italy and had a displacement of about 7,800 tons. Their main armament was different. Kasuga had one single 10-inch gun forward and one twin 8-inch gun at the rear, while Nisshin had two twin 8-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_573;The *Furutaka-class* was a pair of heavy cruisers constructed during 1922–1926. They were the first heavy cruisers of Japan, this is why they were otherwise named A-Class by the Imperial Japanese Navy. Their displacement was 9,540 tons at full load and they were exceptionally fast with a top speed of 34,5 knots. At their final stage of modernization in the 1930s, they had a main armament of three twin 8-inch guns (replacing the previous 6x1 7.9-inch guns), four 4.7-inch guns, eight twin AA guns, and two quadruple 24-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_574;The *Aoba-class* were two heavy cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy built during 1924–1927. Compared to the preceding Furutaka-class, they were slightly smaller, with a displacement of 8,900 tons at full load, they had almost equal top speed of 34 knots, same secondary guns and torpedo armament but they had a distinct difference in their main guns. The Aoba cruisers had three twin 7.9-inch guns instead of six single guns of the Furutaka. The Aoba-class became fully modernized in the 1930s and had an extensive service in World War II.
$LoadingScreens_Text_575;The *Myōkō-class* were four heavy cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, built during 1924–1929. They were the first Japanese cruisers that exceeded the Washington Naval Treaty limit and had a total displacement of almost 15,000 tons. Their main armament was five twin 7.9-inch guns which was considered the most powerful in the world for cruisers of  that time. Compared to previous Japanese heavy cruisers, the Myōkō-class was much better protected with armor and faster, having a top speed that reached 36 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_576;The *Takao-class* were four heavy cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, built during 1927–1930 as an improvement of Myōkō-class. These ships had a distinctive large tower and were considered overweight and rather unstable. Their displacement was over 15,000 tons and had a top speed that varied from 34 to 35.5 knots. Initially they had a main armament of five twin 7.9 inch guns, four 4.7 inch guns, four AA guns and four twin 24-inch torpedo tubes. After their modernization, their armament varied but all gained extensive increase in their AA capability and torpedo power.
$LoadingScreens_Text_577;The *Mogami-class* were four heavy cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy built during 1931–1935. Initially they were classified as light cruisers and were designed to satisfy the London Naval Treaty with an official displacement of only 8,500 tons and five triple dual-purpose 6.1-inch guns as main armament. Later the ships became heavily modified, stretching their displacement to almost 14,000 tons and replacing their main armament with 3x2 8.0-inch guns. The Mogami-class, although powerful, was considered overweight and suffered from instability and hull cracking when firing main guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_578;The *Tone-class* was the last heavy cruiser series of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Two ships were constructed in the 1930s, “Tone” and “Chikuma”, that were originally envisioned to belong in the Mogami-class. But when Japan stopped following naval treaties, these ships took a different design path without displacement restrictions. At full load they had a displacement of about 15,500 tons and carried all main armament mounted forward of the bridge (4x2 8.0 inch guns). At the stern there was large space for up to six spotter planes. As usual for all Japanese cruisers, they had a very strong torpedo armament of four triple 24-inch tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_579;The *Izumi-class* cruiser was a ship that first served the Chilean Navy under the name “Esmeralda” and in 1894 was sold to Japan. This ship belonged to a ground breaking family of british-made cruisers, commonly known as "Elswick cruisers". When it was completed in 1884 it was considered the world’s first true protected cruiser, due to its unique characteristics. Izumi had a displacement of 2,977 tons and a top speed of 18,25 knots. The initial armament was heavier with two single 10-inch main guns, but after 1902 it was replaced by 6-inch guns, more secondaries and torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_58;*Casemate guns* are mounted in protected placements of the ship and require less tons of mounting equipment compared to turreted guns. Their main advantage is that, in those positions, they do not obstruct bigger guns. Their disadvantage is that their fire arc is more limited from turreted guns and if placed in lower sections they may become wet and ineffectual during bad weather.
$LoadingScreens_Text_580;The *Naniwa-class* were two protected cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy built in Britain between 1884-1885. These ships were considered an upgraded design of the Chilean “Esmeralda-Class” cruiser and were very powerful for their time, armed with two single 10-inch guns, six 6-inch guns, twenty smaller guns and four 14-inch torpedo tubes. Their deck armour reached 3 inches in thickness while their displacement was 3,709 tons and their top speed was 18.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_581;The *Matsushima-class* was a group of three protected cruisers built during 1888–1894 for the Imperial Japanese Navy. These ships of about 4,300 tons were designed under the theory of countering the bigger Chinese fleet, with lighter and faster vessels. They were armed with a single 12.6-inch gun, multiple smaller guns and four torpedo tubes. In practice, the big gun proved impractical because of its recoil that was too much for the small size of the hull.
$LoadingScreens_Text_582;The *Yoshino-class* was a protected cruiser of the Imperial Japanese Navy built during 1892–1893 by the Armstrong Whitworth shipyards in Elswick, Britain. It was a typical “Elswick” cruiser design with good deck protection which reached 4.5 inches in thickness. The displacement was about 4,200 tons and the top speed was 23 knots. The main armament consisted of four 6-inch guns supported by eight 4.7-inch guns, twenty-two 1.85-inch guns and five torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_583;The *Tagasako-class* was a protected cruiser of the Imperial Japanese Navy built during 1896–1898 by the Armstrong Whitworth shipyards in Elswick, Britain. This ship of about 4,300 tons carried an armament of two 8-inch guns, ten 4.7-inch guns, eighteen smaller guns and five 18-inch torpedo tubes. The top speed was 23.5 knots. Tagasako had a very active service during the Russo-Japanese War until she was sunk by a mine in December 1904 taking 273 crew and officers with her.
$LoadingScreens_Text_584;*Chiyoda* was a cruiser of the Imperial Japanese Navy completed in 1891 that fought in the First Sino-Japanese War, Russo-Japanese War and World War I. Chiyoda’s small displacement of 2,478 tons and light armament prevented the classification to an armoured cruiser. The design could be termed a “Belted Cruiser” because of the heavy belt armour that reached 3.6 inches in thickness. Ten 4.7-inch guns, seventeen smaller guns and three torpedo tubes comprised the armament, while her top speed was 19 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_585;The *Kasagi-class* consisted of two protected cruisers built in US shipyards during 1896–1897. These ships were funded by war reparations received from China after her defeat in the Sino-Japanese War. They were armed with two 8-inch guns, ten 4.7-inch guns, eighteen smaller guns and five torpedo tubes. Their displacement was 4,900 tons and their top speed was 22,5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_586;The *Suma-class* was a group of two protected cruisers, designed and built in Japan during 1892–1899. They were armed with two single QF 6-inch guns, six 4.7-inch guns and eighteen other smaller guns. Two 15-inch underwater torpedo tubes supplemented the armament. The Suma-class cruisers were relatively small with a displacement of 2,700 tons and not exceptionally fast with a top speed of 20 knots, but they were very versatile and had a long active service till the 1930s.
$LoadingScreens_Text_587;The *Niitaka-class* was a group of two protected cruisers built during 1901–1904 in Japan. These ships of about 3,350 tons were an improvement of the preceding Japanese protected cruiser “Suma”. They were armed with six QF 6-inch guns, fourteen smaller guns and no torpedo tubes, as they were considered hazardous of detonation by the designers. Their maximum speed was 20 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_588;*Otowa* was a Japanese protected cruiser built during 1903–1904 in a rapid construction program of the Imperial Japanese Navy prior to the Russo-Japanese War. Due to lack of funds, this ship was built slightly smaller and with lighter weaponry than designed. Otowa had a displacement of 3,048 tons and was armed with two QF 6-inch guns, six 4.7-inch guns and four 3-inch guns, while it was the last Japanese ship built with a naval ram. The top speed was 21 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_589;*Akitsushima* was a Japanese protected cruiser built during 1892–1894 in Japanese facilities. With 3,150 tons of displacement, she could carry four 6-inch guns, six 4.7-inch guns, twelve smaller guns and four 14-inch torpedo tubes. The top speed of this vessel was 19 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_59;*Gun technology* improves the gun accuracy, reload, range and penetration, so it required careful examination whether to use bigger guns of older technology or smaller guns of more advanced technology.
$LoadingScreens_Text_590;The *Chikuma-class* was the last series of protected cruisers for the Imperial Japanese Navy and along with the Kongō-class battlecruisers, belonged to the first Japanese naval program to build a high speed navy. The three ships of the class were built during 1912–1914. They had a displacement of about 5,100 tons and a top speed of 26 knots, which was achieved by their turbine engines. The armament comprised eight 6-inch guns, four 3-inch guns, two machine guns and three 18-inch torpedo tubes. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_591;The *Tenryū-class* was the first “Light Cruiser” series of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The two ships of the class were built during 1917–1919 and were intended to function as flagships of Destroyer flotillas. Equipped with strong geared turbine engines they had twice the horsepower of the previous Chikuma-class and could reach the top speed of 33 knots. Their maximum displacement was about 4,400 tons and were armed with four 5.5-inch guns, two 3.15-inch guns, two machine guns and six 21-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_592;The *Kuma-class* was a group of five light-cruisers constructed during 1917–1921 for the Imperial Japanese Navy. They had a maximum displacement of 5,926 tons and a top speed of 36 knots provided by their 90,000 shp geared turbine-engines. They were armed with seven 5.5-inch guns, four AA guns and eight 21-inch torpedo tubes, which had up to eight reloads. Additionally, the Kuma cruisers carried up to 48 naval mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_593;The *Nagara-class* was a series of six light cruisers built during 1920–1924 for the Imperial Japanese Navy as an improvement of the preceding Kuma-class. Their standard displacement was about 5,659 tons and had a top speed of 36 knots. Their main difference with Kuma-class was in the arrangement of the superstructure that allowed an aircraft catapult. Kuma-class had to be reconstructed in the 1930s to obtain this capability. Otherwise, the armament was similar, featuring seven 5.5-inch guns, two AA guns and eight 21-inch torpedo tubes, as well as 48 mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_594;The *Sendai-class* were three light cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy built during 1922–1925. Visually, they were quite similar with the Nagara-class, featuring a better boiler system and four funnels instead of three. Their main difference was the extreme torpedo armament of twenty-four 24-inch torpedo tubes. Their displacement was about 5,700 tons and their top speed reached 35.3 knots. The main armament was seven 5.5-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_595;*Yūbari* was an experimental Japanese light cruiser completed in 1923, designed to have the same firepower with the Sendai-class but at a much smaller size.  With a displacement of about 4,000 tons, Yubari hosted six 5.5-inch guns, two twin 24-inch torpedo tubes and several AA guns. The protection scheme was very light, similar to a Destroyer, in order to obtain a top speed of 35.5 knots. Yubari’s innovative design influenced the development of Japan’s next generation of Heavy Cruisers and Destroyers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_596;The *Agano-class* was a series of four light cruisers that was intended to replace the older Tenryū, Kuma, and Nagara-class cruisers. Their design was completed in 1937 but construction was delayed due to overloading of the Japanese shipyards. With a maximum displacement of 7,470 tons, these cruisers could travel at 35 knots and were armed with six 6-inch guns, four 3-inch guns, ten AA guns and two quadruple torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_597;The *Ikazuchi-class* was the first series of Torpedo-Boat Destroyers for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Six vessels were built between 1897 and 1899 in Britain that had a maximum displacement of 420 tons. Their top speed was 30 knots and were armed with one 3-inch gun, five 2.2-inch guns and two 18-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_598;The *Murakumo-class* were six Torpedo-Boat Destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy that were built in Britain during 1898–1900. They had a maximum displacement of 367 tons and a top speed of 30 knots. Their armament consisted of one 3-inch gun, five 2.2-inch guns and two 18-inch torpedo tubes. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_599;The *Akatsuki-class* was a group of two Japanese Torpedo-Boat Destroyers, built in Britain during 1901–1902. Their design was similar to the Royal Navy’s B-Class known as “30-Knotters”. They had a maximum displacement of 422 tons and a top speed of 30 knots and were armed with one 3-inch gun, five 2.2-inch guns and two 18-inch torpedo tubes. Both vessels were delivered to Japan on time to be ready to fight in the Russo-Japanese war. The lead ship, “Akatsuki” was sunk by a mine in this war.
$LoadingScreens_Text_6;Guns slowly improve their aiming by firing *bracketing salvos* with a methodical procedure. Firing successive double shots in front and behind of the target, gradually determine the target’s range and bearing. When the target becomes acquired then the guns start firing rapidly with their maximum fire rate.
$LoadingScreens_Text_60;The *gun muzzle velocity* is the initial speed of the shell at the moment of firing but is not fully indicative on how fast it can travel to the target. The shell maintains its speed and striking velocity according to its weight. So, the bigger the shell, the slower it decelerates due to air drag and the flatter its striking angle.
$LoadingScreens_Text_600;The *Shirakumo-class* were two Torpedo-Boat Destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, built during 1901–1902 in British shipyards. They had a displacement of 428 tons and a top speed of 31 knots. They were armed with one 3-inch gun, five 2.2-inch guns and two 18-inch torpedo tubes.  Both ships fought at the Russo-Japanese war and played a crucial role in the Battle of Tsushima.
$LoadingScreens_Text_601;The *Harusame-class* were the first Torpedo-Boat Destroyers of Japan that were built in domestic shipyards. Seven vessels were constructed during 1902–1905 with a maximum displacement of 435 tons. Their armament comprised two 3-inch guns, four 2.2-inch guns and two 18-inch torpedo tubes. Their top speed was 29 knots. All ships fought in the Russo-Japanese War, one of them was sunk by a mine in Port Arthur. The rest survived to fight again in World War I.
$LoadingScreens_Text_602;The *Kamikaze-class* was the first Destroyer class that was mass-produced in Japan. 32 Torpedo-Boat Destroyers of this type were built during 1904–1909 with a maximum displacement of 460 tons and top speed of 29 knots. Their armament was two 3-inch guns, four 3-inch short barrelled guns and two 18-inch torpedo tubes. Only two vessels were constructed promptly to fight in the Russo-Japanese War. The rest were completed at a time they were considered obsolete compared to foreign standards and were converted to minesweepers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_603;The *Umikaze-class* was the first large Destroyer class of the Imperial Japanese Navy that was designed to service in open ocean waters. Two ships were constructed during 1904–1909, featuring a displacement of 1,170 tons and a top speed of 33 knots. Their armament comprised two 4.72-inch guns,  five 3.15-inch guns and two 18-inch torpedo tubes. Umikaze Destroyers were proven inefficient due to the extreme fuel consumption of their turbine engines, which limited their operational role to coastal patrol duties.
$LoadingScreens_Text_604;The *Sakura-class* was a group of two destroyers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy during 1911–1912. The preceding Umikaze class was larger and had turbine engines. The Sakura Destroyers were much smaller with 830 tons of displacement and their standard coal-fired triple expansion steam engines provided a lower speed of 30 knots. However, their fuel consumption was much smaller, increasing three times their operational range and thus their service effectiveness.
$LoadingScreens_Text_605;The *Urakaze-class* destroyers were the last built in foreign shipyards for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Two ships were ordered before World War I to Yarrow shipbuilders and were intended to be the first Japanese vessels without coal fuel. During the war, one ship was delivered to Japan and the other one was sold to Italy as emergency aid from her allies. Urakaze had a displacement of about 1,100 tons and a top speed of 30 knots.  The armament comprised one 4.72-inch gun,  four 3.15-inch guns and two twin 21-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_606;The *Kaba-Class* was a group of ten Japanese destroyers built during World War I (1914–1915) under an emergency naval construction program. Twelve more similar ships were ordered by the French Navy with the class name “Arabe-class”. Considering how quickly these Destroyers were built in various Japanese shipyards, it was remarkable they all had uniform characteristics. Their displacement was 820 tons and their top speed was 30 knots. Their armament comprised one 4.7-inch gun, four 3-inch guns and two twin 21-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_607;The *Isokase-class* were four Japanese destroyers built at the last stages of World War I, during 1916–1917. They were large vessels of 1,570 tons and their turbine engines offered them the top speed of 34 knots. The armament comprised four 4.7-inch guns, three twin 21-inch torpedo tubes and five machine guns for AA protection.
$LoadingScreens_Text_608;The *Momo-class* was a group of four destroyers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy during 1916–1917. They were constructed in parallel with the bigger Isokase-class Destroyers as part of the “Hachi-Hachi Kantai” program, which featured fast moving capital ships, so the destroyers had to be equally fast to escort them. The Momo-class destroyers had a displacement of 1,100 tons and top speed of 31,5 knots. They were armed with three 4.7-inch guns, three twin 21-inch torpedo tubes and two AA guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_609;The *Enoki-class* was a group of six Japanese destroyers built in an emergency program at the end of World War I, in 1918, as Japan needed more ships to guard local waters while the majority of her Destroyers were operating in the Mediterranean against Germany. The Enoki-class was very similar to the preceding Momo-class but had a sturdier hull to withstand heavy seas  more effectively. The displacement was 1,100 tons and the top speed was 31.5 knots. Three 4.7-inch guns, three twin 21-inch torpedo tubes and two AA guns consisted of the armament.
$LoadingScreens_Text_61;Compared to small guns, the *bigger and more advanced guns* are able to fire bigger shells at a velocity that is providing greater range and striking power. This firepower cannot be underestimated when you design warships.
$LoadingScreens_Text_610;The *Kawakaze-class* was a pair of destroyers built during 1917–1919 for the Imperial Japanese Navy. These ships of 1,610 tons had a top speed of 37,5 knots and were armed with three 4.7-inch guns, two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes and two AA guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_611;The *Momi-class* was a large series of 21 destroyers built during 1918–1922 for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Their design had similar characteristics with German Destroyers, including a lengthened forecastle and torpedo tubes mounted forward of the bridge. With a maximum displacement of about 1,000 tons their armament was quite heavy, featuring three 4.7-inch guns, and two twin 21-inch torpedo tubes. Their steam turbine engines offered a top speed of 36 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_612;The *Minekaze-class* was a large series of 15 destroyers built during 1918–1922 for the Imperial Japanese Navy. They were large destroyers with a maximum displacement of 1,680 tons and had an exceptional speed of 39 knots.  The Minekaze class was designed to escort the Amagi-class battlecruiser which eventually was never completed. Their armament comprised four 4.7-inch guns, three twin 21-inch torpedo tubes, two AA guns and capability to host naval mines and depth charges.
$LoadingScreens_Text_613;The *Wakatake-class* was a group of medium sized destroyers built during 1921–1923 for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Only eight ships were built from the planned twenty-three due to budgetary reasons and the Washington Naval Treaty. Their displacement was 1,100 tons and had a maximum speed of 36 knots. They were armed with three 4.7-inch guns, two twin 21-inch torpedo tubes, two AA guns and could carry naval mines or depth charges.
$LoadingScreens_Text_614;The *Kamikaze-class* constructed between 1921 and 1925 was a series of Japanese Destroyers (the first Kamikaze-class was produced during 1905–1909). Nine ships were built with a maximum displacement of 1,750 tons and top speed of about 37 knots. They were armed with four 4.7-inch guns, three twin 21-inch torpedo tubes, two AA guns and could mount naval mines or depth charges.
$LoadingScreens_Text_615;The *Mutsuki-class* was a series of twelve destroyers built during 1924–1927 for the Imperial Japanese Navy. They had a maximum displacement of 1,468 tons and a top speed of about 37 knots. As originally built, they were armed with four 4.7-inch guns, two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes, two AA guns as well as several naval mines and depth charges. During World War II they were refitted to host even stronger torpedo armament and more AA guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_616;The *Fubuki-class* was a large series of Japanese Destroyers and was considered the world’s first modern destroyer at the time it was introduced, setting new design standards for all navies. A total of 24 ships were built during 1926–1932 that had a maximum displacement of about 2,000 tons and a top speed of 38 knots. They were armed with three twin 5.0-inch dual purpose guns, three triple 24-inch torpedo tubes and two AA guns. The Fubuki destroyers combined a strong armament and  large operational range that made them formidable opponents during World War II.
$LoadingScreens_Text_617;The *Akatsuki-class* destroyer is considered a modification of Fubuki-class with main difference the more advanced high pressure boilers that offered the same power in less number, allowing the weight savings to be used for improved fire control systems and better torpedo tubes. Four ships of this class were built during 1930–1932 with displacement up to 2,000 tons at full load and top speed of 38 knots. The armament was the same with Fubuki, featuring three twin 5.0-inch guns (dual purpose), three triple 24-inch torpedo tubes and two AA guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_618;The *Hatsuharu-class* was a group of six destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, built during 1931–1935. They were constructed under constraints imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty which forbidded more big destroyers like the Fubuki-class. The limited size of those destroyers pushed their design to the limits and caused stability issues. With a displacement of about 1,500 tons they could achieve the top speed of 36 knots and carried an armament of two twin 5.0-inch guns, one single 5.0-inch gun, two triple 24-inch torpedo tubes and several depth charges.
$LoadingScreens_Text_619;The *Shiratsuyu-class* was a series of six large destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, built during 1933–1937. They were based on the previous Hatsuharu-class but were constructed under lighter treaty limitations, so they were made quite larger and more powerful. Their displacement was 1,712 tons and were armed with two twin 5.0-inch guns, one single 5.0-inch gun, two quadruple 24-inch torpedo tubes and several depth charges. Due to their heavy torpedo armament and larger hull, their top speed was smaller, about 33 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_62;When mounting big guns on a ship that is not sufficiently protected with armor and damage control technologies, it is like playing with fire. The size of guns and their respective ammo makes your ships prone to *detonation* if shells penetrate the hull near the magazine section.
$LoadingScreens_Text_620;The *Asashio-class* was a series of ten destroyers, constructed during 1935–1939 for the Imperial Japanese Navy. They were built without any constraints of naval treaties, so they were much larger and more powerful compared to the previous Shiratsuyu-class. Their displacement was 2,408 tons and carried 50,000 shp turbine engines that provided a top speed of 35 knots. The armament comprised three twin 5.0-inch guns, two quadruple 24-inch torpedo tubes (with eight reloads) and up to 32 AA guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_621;The *Kagero-class* was a group of 19 destroyers, built during 1937–1941 for the Imperial Japanese Navy. It was an improved design based on the preceding Asashio-class, featuring 2,500 tons of displacement and an armament of three twin 5.0-inch guns and two quadruple 24-inch tubes that could fire oxygen fueled torpedoes, widely known as “Type 93 Long Lance”, the most advanced torpedoes in the world at those times. The armament also included plenty of AA guns and depth charges.
$LoadingScreens_Text_622;The sea vessels known as *MAS* (Motoscafo Armato Silurante: "torpedo armed motorboat") belonged to a special class of very small torpedo armed boats used exclusively by the Italian Royal Navy during World War I. Their design was derived by civilian motorboats and were equipped with compact petrol engines, which at that time they were rare and uncommon. The most famous vessel of this type is MAS 15 which had a displacement of 30 tons and carried up to two torpedo tubes and one machine gun. MAS-15 became known for sinking the Austro-Hungarian dreadnought SMS Szent István.
$LoadingScreens_Text_623;The *Fulmine-class* was the first torpedo boat destroyer of the Royal Italian Navy and was built in Italian shipyards during 1896–1898. This ship of 342 tons had a sufficient armament of five 2.24-inch guns and three 14-inch torpedo tubes but, due to hull construction issues, it was impossible to satisfy the designed top speed of 26.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_624;The *Lampo-class* was a group of six torpedo boat destroyers of the Royal Italian Navy. These vessels were constructed in German shipyards during 1899–1902 and had a typical design for that time, featuring a raised turtleback forecastle, a ram bow and two funnels. Their displacement was 354 tons and their top speed was 31 knots. The armament for most of these ships was one 3-inch gun, five 2.24-inch guns and two 14-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_625;The *Nembo-class* was a series of six torpedo boat destroyers of the Royal Italian Navy, that were constructed during 1899–1905 in Italian shipyards. Their design and equipment was based on the “Thirty-knotter” destroyers produced by the British shipyard “Thornycroft”. With a maximum displacement of 390 tons they had a top speed of 30 knots and their armament varied. Two of them had one 3-inch gun, five 2.24-inch guns and two 14-inch torpedo tubes and the rest were equipped with five 2.24-inch guns and three 14-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_626;The *Soldato-class* was a series of eleven destroyers built for the Royal Italian Navy during 1905–1913. One of them was meant to be sold to China but eventually was kept by Italy due to the increased needs of the Italian fleet at that time. These were the most modern destroyers of the Italian Navy when the Italo-Turkish War broke out, featuring a displacement of 431 tons and a top speed of 28.5 knots, while four of those ships were equipped with oil-fired boilers which provided bigger range. Their armament comprised four 2.24-inch guns, three 14-inch torpedo tubes, as well as 10 mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_627;The *Indomito-class* was the first large destroyer and the first fitted with steam turbines for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina). Six ships of the class were built during 1910–1913 with a displacement of 770 tons and an armament of one 4.7-inch gun, four 3-inch guns and two 17.7-inch torpedo tubes. Their 16,000 hp engine provided a top speed of 30 knots. During World War I, two of the ships were sunk while the rest had their older guns replaced by five 4-inch guns and one AA machine gun.
$LoadingScreens_Text_628;The *Audace-class* was a pair of Italian destroyers built during 1912–1913 as an improvement of Indomito-class. Their displacement was 820 tons and had a top speed of 30 knots offered by their 16,000 hp steam turbine engines. Their armament was one 4.7-inch gun, four 3-inch guns and two 17.7-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_629;The *Rosolino Pilo-class* was a group of eight Italian destroyers built during 1913–1916. Four of them were lost during World War I and the rest continued to service the Italian Navy until 1958. When they were first built they had a maximum displacement of 912 tons and a top speed of 30 knots. Their armament was four 3-inch guns, two AA guns and four 17.7-inch torpedo tubes and ten mines. In the 1920s their gun armament was replaced by two 4-inch, six 2.5-inch, and two pom-pom AA guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_63;Ships with a *uniform main gun battery* aim faster, because their salvo shots create water splashes that are more easily observed if they do not conflict with splashes of other gun types. Therefore, an “all big gun” ship with many guns of the same caliber is capable of acquiring a target faster than a ship of mixed gun caliber.
$LoadingScreens_Text_630;The *Vifor-class* was a group of four Italian-built destroyers meant to be sold to Romania. They were constructed during World War I (1914–1918) and eventually were kept for use in the Italian Royal Navy. They were large ships of almost 1,800 tons, so they were reclassified to “Scout Cruisers” (esploratori). Their 40,000 hp geared steam-turbine engines provided a top speed of 34 knots. Their armament consisted of three 6-inch guns, four 4-inch guns, two twin 17.7-inch torpedo tubes and several mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_631;The *Regele Ferdinand-class* were two destroyers built in Italy for the Romanian Navy during 1927–1930. Their design was similar to the British Shakespeare-class destroyer leader, but they used imported armament and equipment from many other countries. When these ships were completed, they had a maximum displacement of 1,880 tons and were armed with five 4.7-inch guns, three AA guns, two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes and plenty of depth charges and mines. Their top speed was 37 knots. During World War II they were the most modern and powerful warships of the Axis powers in the Black Sea.
$LoadingScreens_Text_632;The *Freccia-class* was a group of eight destroyers built in Italian shipyards during 1929–33. Four of them were used in the Italian Navy and the rest four were sold to Greece as a modified design “Kountouriotis-class”. The Greek version had two twin 4.7-inch guns instead of four single turrets. In other terms the ships were mostly similar, having a maximum displacement of 2,150 tons and a top speed of 38 knots. Their armament included also six AA guns, two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes and up to 54 mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_633;The *Folgore-class* was a group of four destroyers built for the Italian Navy during 1929–1931. They were a modified version of Freccia-class with a reduced beam to increase speed but this also created stability problems and lessened their operational range. These destroyers had a maximum displacement of 2,130 tons and a top speed of 38 knots. Their armament included two twin 4.7-inch, six AA guns, two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes and 54 mines. Four similar ships were exported to Turkey with the names Tinaztepe-class and Adatepe-class destroyers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_634;The *Maestrale-class* was a group of four destroyers built during 1931–1934 for the Italian Navy. These ships were enlarged versions of subsequent designs with a displacement of 2,255 tons. Their geared steam-turbine engines of 44,000 hp provided a top speed of 38 knots. Their armament comprised two twin 4.7-inch guns, six AA guns, two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes and 56 mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_635;The *Oriani-class* was a group of four destroyers built during 1931–1934 for the Italian Navy. These destroyers of about 2,500 tons were quite enlarged compared to subsequent designs in order to fit larger machinery. The 48,000 hp engines offered a top speed of 39 knots. Their armament was two twin 4.7-inch guns, ten AA guns, two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes and 56 mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_636;The *Soldati-class*, also known as “Camicia Nera class” was a large series of Italian Destroyers built before and during World War II. Twelve ships were constructed during 1938–39 and five more were completed between 1942–1943. Their armament was two twin 4.7-inch guns, thirteen AA guns, two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes and 48 mines. Their maximum displacement was 2,590 tons and their speed varied. The first version, completed before the war, had stronger engines and a top speed of 38 knots. The second version was slower with a top speed of 35 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_637;*Piemonte* was an Italian protected cruiser constructed during 1887–1889 by the British shipyard “Armstrong Whitworth”. This vessel of about 2,500 tons is considered the first major warship equipped with QF (quick firing) guns. The armament comprised six 6-inch guns, six 4.7-inch guns, thirteen small caliber guns and three 14-inch torpedo tubes. Piemonte achieved the top speed of 22 knots and had a rich service during the Italo-Turkish War.
$LoadingScreens_Text_638;The *Regioni-class* was a group of six protected cruisers built during 1888–1901 for the Italian Royal Navy. The ships were built in four different Italian shipyards and varied slightly in dimensions. They had a maximum displacement between 2,450 and 3,160 tons while their speed differed from 17.9 to 20 knots. Their armament was four 5.9-inch guns, six 4.7-inch guns, eleven lighter guns and two 18-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_639;*Calabria* was an Italian protected cruiser built during 1892–1894. This small ship had a displacement of about 2,700 tons and a top speed of 16,4 knots. The armament comprised four 5.9-inch guns,  four 4.7-inch guns, sixteen lighter guns and two 18-inch torpedo tubes. Calabria’s main service was in the closed waters of the Red Sea during the Italo-Turkish war.
$LoadingScreens_Text_64;The *submerged torpedo launchers* are placed underwater and are found in large capital ships. They have reduced fire arc and less tubes compared to deck torpedo launchers but they are preferable in capital ships, because they are safer to use.
$LoadingScreens_Text_640;*Libia* was a protected cruiser built in Italy during 1907–1912 that was to be delivered to Turkey but, due to the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish war, was seized by the Italian Navy. Libia had a displacement of about 4,500 tons and a top speed of 22,9 knots. Her armament was two 6-inch guns, eight 4.7-inch guns, fourteen lighter guns and four 18-inch torpedo tubes. Libia had a quite long and active service that started from World War I and ended in 1937, when she was scrapped.
$LoadingScreens_Text_641;*Quarto* was an Italian protected cruiser built during 1909–1911, the first Italian cruiser with steam turbines. Quarto had a displacement of about 3,500 tons and the 25,000 hp engines provided a top speed of 28 knots. Her armament comprised six 4.7-inch guns, six 3-inch guns, two 18-inch torpedo tubes and up to 200 naval mines. Similar cruisers designed for scout duties were later produced by Italy, such as the classes “Nino Bixio” and “Campania”.
$LoadingScreens_Text_642;The *Giussano-class* was a group of four Italian light cruisers built for the Italian Navy during 1928–1930, as the first series of the Condottieri-class. They were designed to counter the fast French Destroyers in the Mediterranean sea, so they had very little armor but were particularly fast, with a top speed of 37 knots. These ships of 6,844 tons were armed with four twin 6-inch guns, three twin 4-inch guns, sixteen AA guns and two twin 21-inch torpedo tubes, while they could carry two scout planes. Their poor protection scheme was the main reason that all of those ships were sunk in World War II. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_643;The *Cadorna-class* was a pair of Italian light cruisers built during 1930–1932 as the second subgroup of the Condottieri-class. They were almost similar with the previous design but slightly larger and better protected, with a higher displacement of 7,113 tons and the same top speed of 37 knots. Their armament was identical, featuring four twin 6-inch guns, three twin 4-inch guns, sixteen AA guns and two twin 21-inch torpedo tubes. Up to two aircraft could be carried and launched with a catapult.
$LoadingScreens_Text_644;The *Montecuccoli-class* was a pair of Italian light cruisers built during 1931–1934 as the third subgroup of the Condottieri-class. They were larger, better armed and more protected than the preceding classes. These cruisers had a maximum displacement of 8,994 tons and their 106,000 hp engines provided a top speed of 37 knots. Their armament comprised four twin 6-inch guns, three twin 4-inch guns, sixteen AA guns and two twin 21-inch torpedo tubes. Up to two spotting planes could be launched via an aircraft catapult.
$LoadingScreens_Text_645;The *Duca d'Aosta class* was a pair of Italian light cruisers built during 1932–1935. They were the fourth subgroup of the Condottieri-class. These cruisers of about 10,500 tons were slightly larger and significantly more armored than their predecessors and could achieve the top speed of 36.5 knots. Their armament was also better, featuring four twin 6-inch guns, three twin 4-inch guns, twenty AA guns and two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes. After World War II, the first ship was ceded to the Soviet Union, and the second to Greece as war reparations.
$LoadingScreens_Text_646;The *Duca degli Abruzzi class* was a pair of Italian light cruisers built during 1933–1936 and the last fifth group of the broader Condottieri-class. Compared to previous classes, these cruisers were the largest and had the strongest armor protection and armament but they were a bit slower with a top speed of 34 knots. They had a displacement of 11,735 tons and were armed with ten 6-inch guns (in pairs of triple and dual superfiring turrets), four twin 4-inch guns, twenty AA guns, two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes and could host up to four spotting planes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_647;The *Capitani Romani class* was a group of light cruisers that were intended to function as a countermeasure versus the very fast French destroyers of the Le Fantasque and Mogador classes. Twelve ships were planned but only four were completed during 1939–1942. They had a displacement of 5,510 tons and were practically unarmoured in order to save weight and reach the very high top speed of 43 knots. They were armed with four dual 5.3-inch guns, sixteen AA guns and two quadruple 21-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_648;The first armored cruiser for the Italian Royal Navy was named *Marco Polo* and was built during 1890–1894. It was a small ship for its class, with a displacement of 4,583 tons and a top speed of 17 knots. The armament comprised six 6-inch guns, ten 4.7-inch guns, eleven lighter guns and five 17.7-inch torpedo tubes. The maximum armor thickness was 4 inches at the belt.
$LoadingScreens_Text_649;The *Vettor Pisani* class were two armoured cruisers built for the Italian Royal Navy during 1892–1899. These ships of about 6,500 tons had a top speed of 18 knots and were armed with twelve 6-inch guns, up to six 4.7-inch guns, up to twenty-four small caliber guns and four 17.7-inch torpedo tubes. The maximum armor was 6 inches in thickness at the belt and conning tower.
$LoadingScreens_Text_65;The *deck torpedo launchers* are placed above water and can have multiple tubes and rotate, providing a larger efficiency. Deck torpedo launchers are usually not placed in capital ships, due to the height of the hull that makes their launching hazardous, as well as the danger of explosion if they are hit by an enemy shell.
$LoadingScreens_Text_650;The *Giuseppe Garibaldi class* was a large series of Italian-made armored cruisers. In total, ten ships were built during 1895–1904. Three of them were used in the Italian Navy and the rest were sold to Argentina, Japan and Spain. These cruisers had slight differences in size and armament. Their displacement was about 7,500 tons and their top speed was 20 knots. The main armament had two variations, with either two single 10-inch guns or two twin 8-inch guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_651;The *Pisa-class* was a series of three armored cruisers built in Italy during 1905–1909. Two of those ships were commissioned in the Italian Navy and a modified version was sold to Greece with the name “Georgios Averof”. The Italian version of the cruiser had a displacement of 9,832 tons and a top speed of 23 knots. The main armament was two twin 10-inch guns (Averof had 9.2-inch guns). The rest of armament was quite heavy, featuring four twin 7.5-inch guns, sixteen 3-inch guns, eight 1.9-inch guns and three underwater 17.7-inch torpedo tubes. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_652;The Greek armored cruiser *Georgios Averof* was a modified Pisa-class armored cruiser. The ship was first ordered by the Italian Navy but due to financial constraints it was transferred for sale to international customers. Greece acquired the ship in 1909 with the aid of the benefactor Georgios Averof and brought it into service in September 1911. The Greek version of the cruiser was slightly larger with a maximum displacement of 10,400 tons and main guns of 9.2-inch caliber instead of 10-inch of the Pisa-class.
$LoadingScreens_Text_653;The *San Giorgio class* was the last armored cruiser series of the Italian Navy. Two ships of the class were constructed during 1905–1911 with the names “San Giorgio” and “San Marco”. Only the latter was fitted with steam turbines and was considered innovative as the first turbine-powered ship to have four propeller shafts, gyroscopic compass and anti-roll tanks. In other terms the two ships were roughly similar, with a displacement of nearly 11,000 tons and a top speed of about 23 knots. Their armament included two twin 10-inch guns, four twin 7.5-inch guns, twenty lighter guns and three torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_654;The *Trento-class* was the first heavy cruiser series of the Italian Navy. Two ships of the class were built during 1925–1929 under the Washington Naval Treaty but exceeded by far the weight limit with a displacement of 13,548 tons. These cruisers emphasized speed over protection. Their 150,000 hp engines offered a top speed of 35.6 knots on trials. However their average armor of about 2.5 inches was very light and considered inadequate for combat conditions. The armament comprised two twin 8-inch guns, eight twin 4-inch guns, eight AA guns and four twin 21-inch deck  torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_655;The *Veinticinco de Mayo-class* were two heavy cruisers built in Italy during 1927–1929 for the Argentinian Navy. Their design was based on the Italian Trento-class but they had many differences, as they were smaller and even more lightly armored. Their maximum displacement was 9,000 tons and they had a top speed of 31 knots. Their armament was three twin 7.5-inch, six twin 4-inch guns, six AA guns. Their six torpedo tubes were placed in fixed mounts amidships and not in deck launchers, making them hard to aim.
$LoadingScreens_Text_656;The *Zara-class* was a group of four heavy cruisers built during 1929–1932 for the Italian Navy. They were an improvement over the preceding Trento-class, which was considered very lightly protected. With an armored belt that reached 5.9 inches in thickness they were among the most well protected cruisers of that time, but they violated the Washington Naval Treaty terms to accomplish this, as their displacement was over 14,500 tons at full load. The Zara class was armed with four twin 8-inch guns, eight twin 4-inch guns and fourteen AA guns and had a top speed of 32 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_657;*Bolzano* was an Italian heavy cruiser built during 1930–1933  that was based on Trento-class design. Bolzano’s maximum displacement of 13,844 tons exceeded the Washington Naval Treaty and her armor protection was very light in order to host powerful machinery that offered a top speed of 36 knots. The armament included four twin 8-inch guns, eight twin 4-inch guns, twelve AA guns and four twin 21-inch deck  torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_658;The *Re Umberto-class* was a group of three ironclad battleships built during 1884–1895 for the Italian Royal Navy. These were outdated ships for the 1890s compared to other foreign navies, proving Italy’s delay to become competitive in the naval arms race. They had a maximum displacement of 15,702 tons and a top speed of 18.5 knots. The main armament was two twin 13-inch short barreled guns, supported by fifty small secondary guns of various caliber and five 17.7-inch torpedo tubes. 
$LoadingScreens_Text_659;The *Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class* represented the first modern battleship design of the Royal Italian Navy that, in nowadays terms, could be considered a pre-dreadnought class. Two ships were built during 1893–1902 that were rather small for that time standards, only about 10,700 tons. The main armament was two twin 10-inch guns, accompanied by eight 6-inch guns, eighteen lighter guns and four 17.7-inch torpedo tubes. Their top speed was 18 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_66;The longitudinal instability of the ship is expressed by the amount of *Pitch* caused by weight distribution along the centerline of the ship. Pitch motion affects gun accuracy, ship maneuverability and may make the ship more prone to flooding. The hull's base stability reduces those negative effects.
$LoadingScreens_Text_660;The *Regina Margherita class* was the second pre-dreadnought series of the Royal Italian Navy and was designed to compete with the foreign large battleships of that time. Two ships were built during 1898–1905 with a displacement of about 14,700 tons and a top speed of 20 knots. Their armament was two twin 12-inch guns, four 8-inch guns, twelve 6-inch guns, twenty four small caliber guns and four 17.7-inch torpedo tubes. These ships sacrificed armor for speed and firepower, having only 6 inches of belt armor thickness.
$LoadingScreens_Text_661;The *Regina Elena class* was the third pre-dreadnought series of the Royal Italian Navy. Four ships were built during 1901–1908 with a displacement of 14,029 tons and a top speed of 22 knots which was particularly high for a battleship of that time, but not so impressive since those vessels had the size of armored cruisers of other nations. The main armament was two single 12-inch guns supported by twelve 8-inch guns, sixteen 3-inch guns and two 17.7-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_662;*Dante Alighieri* was the first dreadnought battleship of the Royal Italian Navy and was built during 1909–1913, many years after HMS Dreadnought. Dante Alighieri’s displacement was 21,900 tons at deep load. The steam turbine engines offered the power of 32,190 hp and a top speed of 22 knots. The armament comprised four triple 12-inch guns (the first constructed triple guns in the world), twelve single and four twin 4.7-inch guns, thirteen 3-inch guns and three 17.7-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_663;The *Conte di Cavour class* was the second dreadnought series of the Royal Italian Navy. Three ships were built during 1910–1915 with a displacement of about 25,500 tons and a top speed of 21.5 knots. Their main battery comprised three triple 12-inch guns on the centerline and two twin 12-inch guns in superfiring positions fore and aft. The armament included eighteen 4.7-inch guns, fourteen 3-inch guns and three 17.7-inch torpedo tubes. These ships were heavily reconstructed in the 1930s and became faster at 27 knots and more powerful with 12.6-inch main guns. The secondary battery was replaced by six twin 4.7-inch guns and four AA guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_664;The *Andrea Doria class* was the third dreadnought series of the Royal Italian Navy. Two ships were built during World War I (1912–1916) as a slight improvement of the preceding “Conte di Cavour” class. They had a displacement of about 25,100 tons and a top speed of 21.5 knots. Three triple 12-inch guns arranged on the centerline and two twin 12-inch guns in superfiring positions fore and aft consisted of the main battery. Other armament included sixteen 6-inch guns, nineteen 3-inch guns and three torpedo tubes. In the 1930s these ships were refitted with more powerful main guns, stronger engines and multiple AA guns.
$LoadingScreens_Text_665;The *Littorio-class* was the fourth and last dreadnought series of the Italian Navy. The ships “Littorio”, “Vittorio Veneto” and “Roma” were built during 1934–1942 as a response to the French “Dunkerque” class. They had a maximum displacement of 45,236 tons which violated the Washington Naval Treaty. Their engines had a power of 128,200 hp and provided the top speed of 30 knots. Their armament included three triple 15-inch guns, twelve 6-inch guns and a complete Anti-Air defense system consisting of 52 AA guns of various sizes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_666;The *Infanta Maria Teresa class* was a group of three armored cruisers built during 1889–1893 for the Spanish Navy. These ships of 6,890 tons were armed with two 11-inch guns, ten 6-inch guns, thirty lighter guns and eight torpedo tubes (two of them submerged). They were fast with a top speed of 20 knots but not well protected as their thick belt of 12 inches covered too narrow an area and their wooden decoration was especially flammable. All of those cruisers were sunk during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba versus the US fleet.
$LoadingScreens_Text_667;*Emperador Carlos V* was a Spanish armored cruiser built during 1895–1898. This ship of 9,090 tons had a top speed of 20 knots and was armed with two single 11-inch guns, eight 5.5-inch guns, sixteen small caliber guns and six underwater torpedo tubes. The armor protection was very low for her class but weight savings allowed a particularly high operational range.
$LoadingScreens_Text_668;*Princesa de Asturias class* was a group of three armored cruisers built during 1896–1903 for the Spanish Navy, as an improvement of the previous “Infanta Maria Teresa-class”. They had a displacement of 6,888 tons and a top speed of 20 knots. They were armed with two 9.4-inch guns, eight 6.5-inch guns and eight 2.2-inch guns. The maximum armor thickness was 11.88 inches at the belt.
$LoadingScreens_Text_669;*Navarra* was a Spanish light cruiser that was constructed during 1920–1923 and served the Spanish fleet till 1956, while she has been renamed two times due to political changes in the country. Navarra had a maximum displacement of 6,450 tons and a top speed of 25.5 knots. Her armament included nine 6-inch guns, four AA guns and two twin 21-inch deck torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_67;The transverse instability of the ship is expressed by the amount of *Roll* caused by weight distribution across the beam of the ship. Roll motion affects gun accuracy, ship maneuverability and may make the ship more prone to flooding. The hull's base stability reduces those negative effects.
$LoadingScreens_Text_670;*Blas de Lezo-class* was a group of two light cruisers built during 1923–1925. They had a displacement of 6,330 tons at full load and their 45,000 hp engines provided a top speed of 29 knots. Initially, they were armed with six 6-inch guns, four AA guns and four triple 21-inch deck torpedo tubes. After their refit in 1944 they became unrecognizable as their superstructure was completely modernized and their armament was enriched with several AA gun mountings.
$LoadingScreens_Text_671;The *Almirante Cervera class* was a group of three light cruisers built during 1923–1929 for the Spanish Navy. Their design by Sir Philip Watts was based on the British Emerald-class cruiser. They had a displacement of 9,385 tons and a top speed of 33 knots. Their armament included three twin 6-inch guns, two single 6-inch guns, four 4-inch guns, three AA guns and four triple 21-inch deck torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_672;The *Canarias-class* was a group of two heavy cruisers built during 1931–1937 for the Spanish Navy. They were a modified design of the British County-class offered by Sir Philip Watts. Their displacement was 13,700 tons and their top speed was 33 knots. Compared to their British counterparts, they had a different boiler arrangement that was trunked into one big funnel (instead of three funnels), more powerful machinery, stronger torpedo protection and larger secondary battery. They were armed with four 8-inch guns, eight 4.7-inch guns, fifteen AA guns and four triple 21-inch deck torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_673;The *Isla de Luzón-class* was a group of two Spanish protected cruisers. They were constructed between 1886 and 1887 and were considered very outdated when they had to fight versus the US forces during the Spanish-American War. Their displacement was 1,030 tons and their speed did not exceed 16 knots. They were armed with six 4.7-inch guns, eight 2.2-inch guns, four machine guns and three 14-inch torpedo tubes. Both of these cruisers were captured in the Battle of Manilla Bay.
$LoadingScreens_Text_674;The *Reina Regente class* was a group of three protected cruisers constructed during the early 1890s for the Spanish Navy. They had a displacement of about 4,800 tons and a top speed of 20.5 knots. They were armed with four 7.9-inch guns, six 4.7-inch guns, six 2.2-inch guns and five underwater torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_675;*Destructor* was a 19th century spanish vessel which is considered the first military ship classified as a “Destroyer”, capable of chasing and destroying smaller torpedo armed ships. Destructor was constructed in 1887 with a displacement of 354 tons and an armament of one 4-inch gun, four 2-inch guns, two 1.5-inch guns and two 14-inch torpedo tubes. The 3,784 hp engines offered a top speed of 22.6 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_676;The *Furor-class* was a group of six torpedo boat destroyers constructed during 1896–1898 for the Spanish Navy. Their design was based on the British “A-Class” or “27 knotters”, featuring small improvements and a higher top speed of 28 knots. Their displacement was about 380 tons and their armament varied for each vessel. The leading ship of the class was armed with two 3-inch guns, two 2-inch guns, two machine guns and two 14-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_677;The *Bustamante-class* was a group of three destroyers, built during 1914–1916 to serve in the Spanish Navy. They were of British design and built in Spanish shipyards. They had a displacement of 580 tons and a top speed of 28 knots. Their armament comprised five 2-inch guns and two twin 18-inch torpedo tubes. Compared to other destroyers of that time, they were considered slow and weakly armed.
$LoadingScreens_Text_678;The *Alsedo-class* was a group of three destroyers, built during 1920–1925 for the Spanish Navy. These ships of British design were similar to the British M-Class destroyers. They had a displacement of 1,336 tons at full load and their 33,000 hp engines offered a top speed of 34 knots. The armament comprised three 4-inch guns, two AA gun and two twin 21-inch torpedo tubes.
$LoadingScreens_Text_679;The *Churruca-class* was a large series of eighteen spanish-made destroyers. Most of them were constructed during 1923–1937 and the last two were completed in the 1950s due to the delays caused by the Spanish Civil War. The first two ships of the class were later sold to Argentina and became the Cervantes-class. The rest served the Spanish Navy for many years, some until 1982. These destroyers of about 2,200 tons had a top speed of 36 knots and were armed with five 4.7-inch guns, five AA guns, two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes and two depth charge launchers.
$LoadingScreens_Text_68;*Increasing weight on center stabilizes the ship* and reduces the Heel and Trim effects. A very effective way to accomplish this, is to increase the engine machinery by adjusting the speed slider.
$LoadingScreens_Text_680;The *Yugumo-class* was the continuation of the preceding Kagero-class destroyer and featured slight improvements, mainly on AA gunnery. The Imperial Japanese Navy built 19 ships of the class during 1940–1944 and all of them were sunk in battles of World War II. Their full displacement was 2,520 tons and their top speed was 35,5 knots. They were armed with three dual 5-inch guns and two quadruple torpedo tubes. Additionally they were fitted with several depth charges and AA guns that were increased in number as World War II progressed.
$LoadingScreens_Text_681;The *Matsu-class* was a series of Japanese destroyers built during 1943–1945. At the last stages of World War II there was a growing need for low-cost ships with simplified design that could be mass produced and serve mainly as convoy escorts or follow the main fleet actions when necessary. The Matsu-class satisfied that role with a displacement of about 1,500 tons, a top speed of 28 knots, main armament of one dual 5-inch gun turret, one single 5-inch gun turret and one quadruple torpedo tube. A  total of 32 vessels were constructed divided into two subclasses.
$LoadingScreens_Text_682;The *Chidori-class* was a series of four torpedo boats constructed for the Imperial Japanese Navy during 1931–1934. These vessels were built under the restrictions of the London Naval Treaty which limited the total tonnage of destroyers for Japan. Those small crafts of about 750 tons supplemented the needs of the Japanese fleet. They had a top speed of 30 knots and were armed with one dual 5-inch gun turret, one single 5-inch gun turret and two twin 21-inch torpedo tubes. Their armament was too heavy for their size, causing stability issues, resulting in one of them to be sunk during a naval exercise.
$LoadingScreens_Text_683;The *Ōtori-class* was a group of eight torpedo boats built for the Imperial Japanese Navy during  1934–1937, as a replacement of the previous Chidori-class which was proven not seaworthy. These new ships had a longer and wider hull while their tower was smaller to lower the center of gravity. Their lighter main armament of three single 4.7-inch guns and one triple torpedo tube was a better choice for a hull that weighed about 1,000 tons at full load. Their top speed was 30.5 knots.
$LoadingScreens_Text_684;*Shimakaze* was an experimental destroyer built for the Imperial Japanese Navy during 1941–1942. It was basically a lengthened version of the Yugumo-class which offered space for three quintuple 24-inch torpedo tubes, the largest and most carried on any destroyer of that time. Furthermore, it hosted very strong turbine engines which allowed the high top speed of 40.9 knots. Shimakaze had a displacement of 3,400 tons at full load and was additionally armed with three dual 5-inch guns, up to sixteen AA guns and several depth charges.
$LoadingScreens_Text_685;The *Leningrad-class* was a series of six destroyers built for the Soviet Navy during 1932–1940. They belonged to the Destroyer-Leader type of ships and their displacement reached 2,720 tons while their top speed was 40 knots. Their armament comprised five single 5.1-inch guns, four AA guns, two quadruple 21-inch torpedo tubes and a large amount of depth charges and mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_686;The *Tashkent-class* was a series of four large destroyers planned to be built for the Soviet Navy but eventually, due to many delays, only one was constructed during 1937–1940 in Italy, right before the outbreak of World War II. Tashkent was a rather unique destroyer that had a displacement of 4,230 tons at deep load and a very high top speed of  almost 43 knots. The armament consisted of three twin 5.1-inch guns, three triple 21-inch torpedo tubes and a large amount of depth charges and mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_687;*Gnevny-class* was a large group of 30 destroyers built for the Soviet Navy during 1935–1942. These ships of about 2,000 tons were particularly fast with a top speed of 38.3 knots and were armed with four single 5.1-inch guns, six AA guns and two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes. Their construction was partially assisted by Italian designers and so they suffered from similar defects of similar Italian destroyers of that time that were exported to Greece and Turkey, including limited seaworthiness and structural weakness.
$LoadingScreens_Text_688;*Storozhevoy-class* was a series of 18 destroyers built for the Soviet Navy during 1936–1942, as an improvement of the previous, somewhat disappointing, Gnevny-class. Their displacement reached 2,243 tons and could achieve a top speed of 40.3 knots. Their armament comprised four single 5.1-inch guns, nine AA guns, two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes and multiple depth charges and mines
$LoadingScreens_Text_689;*Ognevoy-class* was a group of 11 destroyers built for the Soviet Navy during 1938–1948. Hull strength was significantly increased compared to previous classes in order to improve seaworthiness in sea regions where the Soviet navy operated. They were ships of about 2,800 tons and had a top speed of 36.5 knots. Their armament consisted of two twin 5.1-inch guns, eight AA guns, two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes and a large amount of depth charges and mines.
$LoadingScreens_Text_69;*Speed* measured in Knots determines how fast the ship can travel on sea and is one of the most important tactical factors in naval warfare. Fast warships can outmaneuver slower enemies or evade and withdraw when needed. Slow warships will not be able to keep safe distance from torpedo equipped enemies and will be unable to chase weaker targets in order to destroy them.
$LoadingScreens_Text_690;The *Ning-Hai class* was a pair of light cruisers that were built during 1931–1936 for the Republic of China Navy. They were of compact design, not exceeding the 2,500 tons, resembling the Japanese Yubari cruiser. Their armament included six 5.5-inch guns in three turrets, four 21-inch torpedo tubes, several depth charges and AA guns. The lead ship of the class had additionally a small hangar for two floatplanes. Their instability caused by their very tall towers and their low top speed of 23 knots made them only suitable for coastal defence.
$LoadingScreens_Text_7;The *target acquiring* of the guns is dependent on multiple factors. The ship tower and gun technology speeds up the gun aiming, while the distance, speed and maneuvering of the target may slow down or even completely reset the targeting procedure.
$LoadingScreens_Text_70;Fast warships are able to maintain a *cruising speed* which maximizes their accuracy and at the same time is high enough to make them more difficult to target.
$LoadingScreens_Text_71;The minimum *operational range* limits the ship to coastal defense and standard naval duties while higher range gives the capability to participate in distant naval raids, surprise strikes and special missions, making it a much more useful and multi-purpose warship.
$LoadingScreens_Text_72;*Bulkheads* are reinforced walls that divide the hull’s interior in multiple rooms. The amount of bulkheads directly affects the ship’s survivability. When the hull is subdivided in many sections, flooding or fire damage are more easily controlled, while the ship’s citadel is far more protected against shells that penetrate the hull. The citadel encloses the machinery and magazine spaces, thus engine damage and ammo detonation become less likely when bulkheads’ division is dense and well armored.
$LoadingScreens_Text_73;*Belt armor* covers the warship from the sides, starting from the main deck down to some distance below the waterline. The belt armor prevents shells or torpedoes from penetrating horizontally to the heart of the hull and cause catastrophic internal damage.
$LoadingScreens_Text_74;*Belt extended* armor is the extension of the belt armor on the bow and stern of the ship. It does not have to be as thick as the belt because projectiles that strike from the front or rear are more easily deflected due to the angle of impact.
$LoadingScreens_Text_75;*Deck armor* covers the warship’s deck surface and protects against long-range plunging fire that can cause devastating damage to the ship’s citadel.
$LoadingScreens_Text_76;*Deck extended* armor expands the deck armor on the bow and stern, making the ship better protected against plunging fire received from the front or rear.
$LoadingScreens_Text_77;The *Conning Tower* is a heavily reinforced structure that shields officers during battles. It is placed in the front-end of the superstructure -typically the front tower- and has very small windows from which the officers can observe the battle. If the Conning Tower becomes damaged, there is a severe penalty in gun accuracy.
$LoadingScreens_Text_78;*Turret armor* shields the main guns against horizontal shell hits, usually inflicted from short and medium distance. Turret armor is typically very strong in battleships because their main guns are their most important weaponry.
$LoadingScreens_Text_79;*Turret top armor* protects the main guns against plunging shell hits that are regularly inflicted from long range fire. Shells that penetrate the turrets from above may cause a catastrophic explosion of their ammo storage.
$LoadingScreens_Text_8;While the ship guns have a *target acquired* there is an additional accuracy bonus that is received over time.
$LoadingScreens_Text_80;The *Secondaries armor* shields all other guns except main guns protecting them from becoming incapacitated.
$LoadingScreens_Text_81;The *Torpedo protection* is a vital protection scheme which reinforces deep underwater sections of the ship in order to absorb the damage of a torpedo hit and reduce the chance of flooding. If a battleship lacks this system, it can be easily sunk by a single torpedo hit.
$LoadingScreens_Text_82;The *Barbette* is a special emplacement on which a gun is deployed in a superfiring position. Although heavy, it can be used to save weight for a warship, since a superfiring turret can replace two equal side guns due to its superior fire arc.
$LoadingScreens_Text_83;On September 22, 1914, the German submarine U-9 under the command of *Otto Eduard Weddigen*, ambushed and sunk the British armored cruisers HMS Aboukir, HMS Hogue and HMS Cressy. 62 officers and 1,397 men were killed, only 837 survived.
$LoadingScreens_Text_84;On October 11, 1914, the German submarine U-26 that was operating in the Baltic Sea, torpedoed and blew up the *Russian Cruiser “Pallada”*, killing the entire crew (597 men).  Pallada was the first Russian warship lost in the First World War.
$LoadingScreens_Text_85;*Maximilian von Spee* (June 22, 1861 - December 8, 1914) was a Naval Commander of the German East Asia Squadron. He became famous for defeating the British West Indies Squadron and sinking the armored cruisers "Good Hope" and "Monmouth" near the Chilean Coast on 11/01/1914.
$LoadingScreens_Text_86;The famous admiral *Maximilian von Spee* died on December 8, 1914 at the Battle of the Falkland Islands where he was forced to engage a superior English Fleet. The naval force of von Spee was almost completely destroyed resulting in the loss of 1,871 crew, including himself and his two sons.
$LoadingScreens_Text_87; “You must not forget that I am quite homeless. I cannot reach Germany. We possess no other secure harbor. I must fight my way through the seas of the world doing as much mischief as I can, until my ammunition is exhausted, or a foe far superior in power succeeds in catching me.

$LoadingScreens_Text_90;*John Jellicoe* (December 5, 1859 – November 20, 1935) was a British Naval Commander who fought in the Anglo-Egyptian War and the Boxer Rebellion and commanded the Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 during the First World War. Jellicoe’s performance in this battle was controversial because he failed to defeat the much smaller German fleet.
$LoadingScreens_Text_91;*George Dewey* (December 26, 1837 - January 16, 1917) is the only person in United States history to have attained the highest possible naval rank “Admiral of the Navy” in recognition of his victory at Manila Bay in 1898 during the Spanish-American War.
$LoadingScreens_Text_92;*Ding Ruchang* (November 18, 1836 - February 12, 1895) was a Chinese admiral who commanded the Chinese Fleet during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. He was defeated at the critical battle of Yalu River, where he lost 5 out of his 10 ships and was injured due to an accidental misfire of his own ship.
$LoadingScreens_Text_93;The Chinese Admiral *Ding Ruchang* despite being completely surrounded by the Japanese fleet in the harbor of Weihaiwei, he refused the offer of asylum and committed suicide on February 12, 1895. He was accused for the defeat and stripped of all honors by the Qing Government but the honourable manner of his death earned him the respect of the Japanese and Chinese Military. When the Qing dynasty was overthrown he was restored to all his ranks and his family was able to give him a proper burial.
$LoadingScreens_Text_94;*Zinovy Rozhestvensky* (November 11, 1848 - January 14, 1909) was in command of the Second Pacific Squadron during the Russo-Japanese War. In the Battle of Tsushima on May 14, 1905 he commanded his fleet for less than 20 minutes before he was knocked unconscious by a severe wound on his head.
$LoadingScreens_Text_95;*Isoroku Yamamoto* (April 4, 1884 - April 18, 1943) served on the Japanese cruiser Nisshin during the Russo-Japanese War and was wounded in the Battle of Tsushima, losing two fingers (index and middle) on his left hand. His naval career evolved to become the most famous admiral of World War II, well known for his success on Pearl Harbor.
$LoadingScreens_Text_96;*Itō Sukeyuki* (May 20, 1843 - January 16, 1914) was a respected admiral of the Japanese Meiji Navy fleet.

$LoadingScreens_Text_97;*Christopher Cradock* (July 2, 1862 - November 1, 1914) was a prominent British Rear Admiral of the Royal Navy. His last fight was given during the First World War versus the larger German fleet of Maximilian von Spee at the Battle of Coronel where he was defeated and killed together with his entire crew aboard the cruiser “Good Hope”.
$LoadingScreens_Text_98;*Pascual Cervera y Topete* (February 18, 1839 - April 3, 1909) was a prominent Spanish admiral who has fought several wars during his career. During the Spanish-American War he believed that the Spanish Navy had no chance for victory over the more advanced United States Navy. Nevertheless, he fought at a last stand during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba where he was defeated and captured.
$LoadingScreens_Text_99;*Patricio Montojo y Pasarón* (September 7, 1839 - 30 September, 1917) was a Rear - Admiral who was given the difficult task of defending the Spanish Philippines with antiquated ships and low supplies against the more formidable U.S. Asiatic Squadron. His defeat at the Battle of Manila Bay (1 May, 1898) by U.S. Navy Admiral George Dewey resulted in being court-martialed and discharged from the Spanish Navy.

Be aware that a small enemy fleet led by an advanced battlecruiser is near and, most likely, it is approaching to attack you.
$MissionData_Desc_complex_test_18;The Battlecruisers are not supposed to directly confront Battleships due to their much lighter armor scheme. However, in this mission you will have to design a Battlecruiser that is powerful enough to destroy a heavily armed Dreadnought. You will have to balance firepower, armor and speed in such a manner that your ship will be able to outmaneuver the battleship and keep inflicting hits, while evading shell fire that could cause critical damage. Be aware that by increasing the Battlecruiser's firepower too much, might dangerously increase the chance of ammo detonation from a penetrating hit.
$MissionData_Desc_complex_test_19;Your goal is to design a battleship with superior fire control and gun technology in order to defeat a strong fleet of dreadnoughts, heavy cruisers and destroyers. Your battleship must be able to sustain heavy damage and be fast enough to keep safe distance from the enemy ships, which will try to encircle you and destroy you with torpedoes or overwhelming close-range gun fire.
$MissionData_Desc_complex_test_2;Try to destroy a powerful dreadnought with a destroyer flotilla. You can build either many Torpedo Boats or less but more advanced Destroyers.
$MissionData_Desc_complex_test_3;You can build an expensive battlecruiser or create a flotilla of cheaper cruiser types. Your mission is to destroy the convoy within the short time limit.
$MissionData_Desc_complex_test_4;You can build an expensive battlecruiser or create a flotilla of cheaper cruiser types. The convoy is escorted by armored cruisers and pre-dreadnoughts. Your mission is to destroy all cargo ships within the time limit.
$MissionData_Desc_complex_test_5;Design a Destroyer Flotilla that can eliminate an enemy convoy and its escorts. The enemy has a strong cruiser for protection that only torpedoes can harm it. You can use two types of Destroyers. Big Destroyer Leaders or standard Destroyers of smaller displacement.
$MissionData_Desc_complex_test_6;The enemy dreadnoughts possess powerful guns and strong armor. You must try to defeat them by having a fleet of more numerous pre-dreadnoughts. You can choose between three pre-dreadnought hull designs.
$MissionData_Desc_complex_test_7;Test the power of a super dreadnought or an advanced battlecruiser against a combined fleet of smaller warships. Your warship will retain the advantage as long as you keep safe distance and steady course to maximize the effectiveness of your heavy guns. Two destroyers will escort you to help you spot enemy light ships and their torpedoes.
$MissionData_Desc_complex_test_8;The enemy fleet possesses two super dreadnoughts, a state of the art battlecruiser and numerous support ships. You have some money to invest on building a fleet of a single warship type. Will you build a few strong battleships, some fast battlecruisers or maybe several more cheaper ships?
$MissionData_Desc_complex_test_9;The enemy attacks your convoy with an advanced battlecruiser. Your resources and technology are limited but if allocated wisely you can defeat the incoming steel monster with cunning tactics or number superiority.
$MissionData_Desc_complex_test_tactics;The USS Maine was an outdated armored warship which, for its time, could be classified as a battleship. What if it survived its explosion and during the Spanish-American War it had to defend Cuban waters against a considerable force of Spanish cruisers and smaller vessels? You will have to design a similar ship which, on paper, cannot compete against numerous faster and more advanced vessels, but this can be proven wrong by a combination of a good design and straightforward naval tactics. Just by keeping safe distance you can outgun all enemy vessels, one by one.
$MissionData_Desc_gun_test_1;Test the significance of gun technology and firepower versus a fast moving light cruiser. Heavy and rapid-fire secondary guns might be useful against this ship, while more advanced big guns can neutralize it quickly due to their increased accuracy.
$MissionData_Desc_gun_test_2;Test the significance of gun technology and firepower versus a heavily armored battleship. The battleship will fight you back and you must destroy it within the time limit. You can build either one battleship or a couple of armored cruisers.
$MissionData_Desc_ironclad_1;CSS Virginia was the first ironclad of the Confederate army and represented the basis of similar "Casemate-Ironclads" that were widely used in the American Civil War. Having its armament in fixed gunports instead of armored turrets, the "Casemate-Ironclad" is considered the intermediate stage between the traditional broadside frigate and the modern warships. You can design a similar ship and fight versus a Monitor-class ironclad, which is considerably smaller but is armed with heavy gun turrets.
$MissionData_Desc_ironclad_2;USS Monitor was an innovative ship of the Union Army, the first ship of its kind, having its guns in a rotating turret instead of a fixed broadside arrangement. Monitor's technology was later adopted and expanded in future warships, while its name "Monitor" was used to describe a special class of ships with disproportionately large guns that were used for bombarding shores during both World Wars. In this mission you may design an ironclad similar to USS Monitor and fight versus a ship larger and more powerful than CSS Virginia, its historical rival in the famous "Battle of Hampton Roads".
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_1;You must design and build ships that can defeat a Semi-Dreadnought and two escorting Light Cruisers. Your design choices are either a pre-dreadnought with a heavy secondary battery or a more advanced armored cruiser. The main strength of the Semi-Dreadnought is its increased number of big guns. In order to fit those guns, the ship sacrifices weight for machinery, secondaries or protection that older types of battleships might have. Nevertheless, the Semi-Dreadnought must not be underestimated, as its heavy guns can pulverize your ships before you can even touch it... two light cruisers will join your forces.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_10;Your mission is to design a battleship worthy of the German fleet and meet a larger English force in open waters. Your main target is their battlecruiser, which is the most advanced ship of their fleet. Due to your limited funds, designing a bigger battleship may limit you from protecting it with strong armor or increase its speed beyond 30 knots. You will be escorted by a heavy cruiser. Both of your ships must survive the engagement since we cannot afford any losses.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_11;The battlecruiser is a versatile ship which is especially effective against cruisers and smaller vessels, ideal for raiding at distant waters. Protecting convoys is another role it can fulfill, but not easily when it has to confront a battleship. This is the situation you will face, because you have to protect our military convoy ships from the most powerful warship of the German Navy and three strong heavy cruisers. Victory can be claimed by either sinking the enemy battleship or destroying the majority of enemy forces. One of our battleships might succeed in reaching you, soon enough to help you out.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_12;A group of large dreadnoughts that have been modernized by the Japanese Navy is sailing back for refueling. You have the opportunity to attack and sink them with your much more powerful super-battleship. You need to deal significant damage to the battleships to claim victory. Beware though, because the battleships are guarded by numerous destroyers, while a bigger Japanese battleship is not far away and will surely join the fight against you. Two advanced destroyers will escort you.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_13;H-class battleships are enlarged versions of the previous Bismarck-class that intend to satisfy the Plan-Z of the Kriegsmarine... to directly challenge and defeat the naval power of the United Kingdom and her allies. You have the chance to build enormous German battleships of the H-Class and fight versus an American fleet led by large modern battleships, which are your main objective.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_14;A German raiding squadron is approaching one of our military convoys, which is escorted by only two light cruisers. Those old light cruisers can only delay the attacking force, which appears to contain a battlecruiser and a heavy cruiser. You must wisely allocate your funds in order to design and build the naval force that will be capable to travel fast and repel the enemy.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_15;Your Battleship will start the battle slightly damaged and will be escorted by a heavy cruiser. The British Fleet is hunting you and wants to sink you at all costs. Two British battleships are leading the attack and are your main priority. If you sink those ships, we can declare victory. But of course you cannot succeed alone. Two of our Battlecruisers (one of them is designated as a "Large Cruiser") are reaching to your position. Converge your forces and counter-attack, in order to set up a trap against the opposing fleet.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_16;A French Battleship -the largest ever seen- is chasing one of our battleships. Our ship is already significantly damaged and will not last for long, but we might take advantage of the situation. The enemy behemoth is operating alone, without destroyer escort. Choose carefully the cruisers that will be dispatched to aid our battleship. Your cruisers can retaliate and punish the French battleship, especially if they are armed with large torpedoes...
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_17;Twenty British cargo ships are your main priority. You must design and build the light cruisers that will consist of your raiding squadron. An enemy armored cruiser will try to stop you. This cruiser is especially dangerous against smaller cruisers due to its multiple medium guns. It might be a good idea to deal with the armored cruiser first, before attacking the convoy, but beware, because a British battlecruiser is approaching. When the battlecruiser arrives, it would be pointless to attack further... you will just have to withdraw!
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_18;Powerful modern cruisers with state of the art fire control and devastating torpedoes should have no problem sinking a dreadnought of older technology. You can prove the opposite, either by enhancing your battleships with equipment of advanced technology, or investing more money for building more ships.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_19;Balance your ship numbers over your technology advances in order to compete against a force of eight outdated destroyers and their leader, which is an advanced and powerful ship. Do not underestimate the enemy, as a destroyer action is usually close and intense, where guns and torpedoes can hurt you dearly, no matter your technology advantage. The enemies might attempt to retreat if they become overwhelmed so the speed of your ships will be a crucial factor for completing this mission.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_2;Your main adversary is a huge battleship with technologies of the 1940s. You will be outgunned, outperformed in every way, but you have the numbers! You must build several capital ships and try to sink this steel monster! Seven destroyers will be at your disposal and can give the final blow to the enemy battleship if you manage to slow it down with your heavy shell fire.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_20;Design the team of destroyers which will attack a large American fleet, consisting of battleships, cruisers and various support ships. Your possible destroyer designs include a wide range of hull types and two specials: An experimental destroyer, which can achieve very high speeds and an experimental cruiser, which combines the benefits of a destroyer at a size of a cruiser.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_21;A powerful Japanese battleship and its escorts attacks one of our major convoys. The only defense is your destroyers. The most sensible action would be to escape while you can. But the High Command decided that you should stand and find an opportunity to sink the enemy battleship with your torpedoes. Only the best designed destroyers can succeed in such a mission.... with a bit of luck.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_22;The British and Germans are concentrating their forces in the vicinity of Jutland and preparing for a major battle. Your task force led by two British battlecruisers has spotted three German capital ships heading to the location. The visibility due to the bad weather is very poor but our scout ships have noticed that their main destroyer escort is at the back of their formation, several kilometers away. We have the opportunity to sail north and engage the German warships from the front with our destroyers while they are unguarded. Our torpedoes can take them down easily if we act fast. Failure to do so, will most likely mean the failure of the mission as the enemy destroyers will certainly retaliate and destroy us.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_23;You will lead a squadron of small destroyers against a Japanese destroyer squadron. The enemy force is led by a flotilla leader, a fast cruiser with many small guns and heavy torpedo armament. The Japanese destroyers are fast, stealthy and usually carry very strong torpedoes. You may choose to build several smaller destroyers or less but much more powerful "Destroyer Leaders" which can outgun most of smaller ships. Be warned, that you should keep a safe distance from the enemy cruiser because it is specialized in dealing with destroyers.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_24;Our naval forces in the Black Sea are scarce and do not include any battleships. The Russians possess more and heavier ships. Two of our remaining cruisers need the support of your destroyers to attack and destroy the commanding Russian ships in the area, a refitted dreadnought and a modern battlecruiser. The enemy supports their large warships with numerous destroyers, which however are of outdated technology. Nevertheless, they should not be underestimated, because if you allow them to flank us, they can devastate us with their torpedoes.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_25_1;The Russian fleet seeks to engage us near the Tsushima strait. They possess a large number of battleships that we are not able to match in numbers. Most of them, however, are outdated and slow. Our fleet has a significant number of cruisers and torpedo boats. You must wisely allocate your funds in order to reinforce our fleet with some strong battleships or build more numerous smaller ships. Your decision will greatly impact the tactics that will be needed in order to defeat our foe. Your mission will not be simple, as we cannot afford great losses, while we must destroy a large proportion of the Russian ships to claim victory.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_26;It is 1913 and the powerful British fleet amasses near the vicinity of the German ports at North Sea. As the British are divided into two groups, you decide to attack and gain a temporary territorial advantage. You will have to choose whether to build Battleships, Battlecruisers or Heavy Cruisers to reinforce your attacking fleet, utilizing a rather limited budget. The British fleet is superior but your own forces can triumph via better tactics and by investing in the most suitable technologies. The main problem is that we do not know the exact location of the approaching fleets. The second British group might appear from behind, in an attempt to encircle you.\n
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_27;It is 1941, near the cape Matapan, south of Greece, where a British and an Italian fleet prepare to fight each other. You are in command of the Italian fleet and you must defeat the enemy without taking heavy losses. Your fleet of cruisers and destroyers can be reinforced either by a few strong battleships, or multiple cruisers of various types, that you will design. The British possess three state-of-the-art battleships, accompanied by many light cruisers and destroyers.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_28;Create a successful striking force made of French modern ships of the 1940s and defeat a strong German fleet which has as a flagship a humongous super battleship of the H-class. The super battleship is your main objective.Your funds should be enough to build at least one super battleship but you can alternatively design and build more smaller ships that could come closer to the German Battleship and launch a torpedo attack. Your forces will be escorted by six modern destroyers.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_29;Germany has prevailed in World War II and has ultimately conquered Europe. France remains a client state and contributes with her naval facilities in the construction of a new, more powerful German Navy. Although weakened, Britain remains a potent naval force and aims to meet, engage and decisively defeat the growing German fleet. With scarce resources you are called to build the main force of your fleet, either focusing on battleships or by building more numerous advanced cruisers. Smaller cruisers and destroyers will supplement your attacking fleet.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_3;Three heavy cruisers are threatening two of our transports. These cruisers possess a mix of firepower, protection and speed that can make them particularly dangerous against other cruisers. You can try to deal with them with a number of your own cruisers or a semi-dreadnought, which although not very maneuverable, its numerous big guns can undoubtedly deliver higher damage. You must sink the enemy cruisers and not let them sink any of our vital transport ships.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_30;The defeat of the German Empire in World War I brought strict terms in her naval construction programs. The need of packing heavy firepower in smaller hulls resulted in the creation of an armored cruiser with very big guns for its size. The French were allowed by naval treaties to build much larger and heavier warships to match this threat. Your mission is to utilize your limited funds to construct an effective force of armored ships or “pocket battleships” as they are usually known and defeat a rival French battlecruiser which protects a convoy. Two destroyers will escort you.\n
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_31;The Japanese Imperial Navy prolonged the active duty for almost all older dreadnoughts instead of scrapping them. On paper, those ships could be formidable opponents for the most modern battleships. Now you must design and build a force of such modernized dreadnoughts and defeat a much larger and extremely powerful US battleship. This battleship is escorted by a small flotilla of destroyers. Your more numerous fleet is also reinforced with a number of destroyers and cruisers so this fight might be in fact more favourable for our side… or maybe not?
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_32;After the fall of the Russian Empire, the new regime had difficulties in raising a fleet powerful enough to correspond with the vast territories of the Russian nation. The Germans are seeking to meet us in the Baltic Sea with a strong fleet. Your current force in the area consists of one modernized dreadnought and a few old destroyers. Your restricted budget allows you to build either a handful of battleships or numerous smaller ships. Will you overwhelm the enemy with sheer numbers or will you just create one super battleship which can sink them one by one?
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_33;Many years have passed since the First Sino-Japanese War and the humiliation of our fleet in the Battle of Yalu river. China has emerged from her ashes and now is able to have a potent naval force, not as powerful as Japan’s but enough to be a considerable threat. A squadron of two Japanese battleships and a few escort ships cause tension by violating our waters. The government decided to risk a war against Japan with a surprise attack that would serve as revenge from the defeats of the past. The weather conditions are perfect for an ambush. We can barely match the firepower of the Japanese battleships with our own battleships, so it would be wiser to have more smaller ships to overwhelm them by your numbers. Eight destroyers will escort your forces.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_34;The old French strategic concept called “Jeune École” of having a main fleet based on numerous light warships equipped with torpedoes and high explosive rounds is now put to the test. The Germans are approaching with several dreadnoughts and a potent force of destroyers escorting them. They are heading near the French coastlines to threaten directly the control of our waters. You have some torpedo boats and some old cruisers and the choice to reinforce them with ships of your design on a rather strict budget. Will you build more cruisers and prove that the “Jeune École” can work or prefer to fight with some battleships instead?
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_4;Your mission is to build a squadron of heavy capital ships and destroy the two enemy battleships that oppose you. These battleships are of experimental US design. They are not particularly fast and are quite cumbersome but feature excellent fire control and protection systems. You must not underestimate their escorting destroyers which will surely attempt to torpedo you if you approach dangerously close to them.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_5;Create a battleship of the 1940s based on the legendary Iowa-class and send it into combat against its mighty foe... a battleship resembling the Yamato-class! The enemy might retreat if overwhelmed so speed and radar will be very important aspects for your design.\n
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_6;The heavy cruisers of the new era focus on speed, maneuverability and superb fire control systems. Guns and armor were historically limited due to naval treaties but now you can design your cruisers without such limitations. Your mission is to destroy the three re-constructed armored cruisers that oppose you. The enemy ships should be not underestimated as their thicker armor and heavy guns can cripple your ships at short distances.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_7;An experimental battlecruiser of Japanese technology is destroying our convoys. It is unclear what are the capabilities of this ship but it is rumoured it is unstoppable versus smaller cruisers. This is why it has been nicknamed "The Cruiser Killer". Your mission is to trace and sink this ship! Don't let it get away! You can risk attacking the enemy with a number of your best heavy cruisers or one of our own experimental battlecruisers. Four destroyers will assist your effort.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_8;A battleship of over 100,000 tons is your main objective. It is escorted by a couple of heavy cruisers and some destroyers. You may build a few modern battleships or more heavy cruisers as your main attack force. You will also have at your disposal four large destroyer leaders.
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_9;A number of very fast and deadly destroyers threaten your battleship. Usually battleships are not intended to fight destroyers without escorting ships but now you must design your battleship in a way that not only can it survive the battle but also sink every single destroyer within the given time limit. You might have to approach in dangerous distance from the destroyers in order to succeed.
$MissionData_Desc_speed_test_1;Build a fast moving ship to capture an escaping destroyer. Your ship must achieve much more than 30 knots speed to catch up with the target. Shooting is not allowed, so you will not be able to slow down your opponent with gunfire.
$MissionData_Desc_speed_test_2;Build a fast moving cruiser to destroy an escaping destroyer. Your ship can either be designed for maximum speed or balance speed with survivability and firepower.
$MissionData_Desc_target_practice_1;Test the significance of gun technology and firepower versus a heavily armored ship, that is stationary and will not shoot back. You must destroy the target within the time limit.

$partcategories_desc_barbette;The *Barbette* is a special emplacement on which a gun is deployed in a superfiring position. Although heavy, it can be used to save weights for a warship, since a superfiring turret can replace two equal side guns due to its superior fire arc.
$partcategories_desc_gun_casemate;These *Casemate Guns* can be only placed in specially fortified emplacements of the ship. Since they are not turreted, they consume less weight but their fire arcs are usually limited according to the available space.
$partcategories_desc_gun_sec;The *Secondary Guns* add to the firepower of the ship and are usually of much smaller caliber than the main guns. Their number and higher rate of fire is very useful for disabling ship compartments or eliminating smaller targets such as destroyers and torpedo boats. Although they do not possess the ammo detonation hazard of larger guns, it is advised to protect them with additional armour to lessen this risk.
$partcategories_desc_hull;The *Hull* determines the ship type. The available hulls become enriched according to technology development, featuring bigger displacement and better characteristics, which are divided in four categories: Endurance, Hull Form, Stability and Floatability. These hull characteristics greatly affect the ship's performance.

$Player_desc1890_austria;The {0} is a multinational union of states forming together a powerful nation. Austria-Hungary is virtually the continuation of the Habsburg Monarchy and is now one of the biggest and most populous countries in Europe, possessing heavy industry and one of the largest land armies in the world. The Austro-Hungarian navy is currently small but not for long, since the monarch rulers of Austria-Hungary do not hide their thirst to build the strongest navy power in the mediterranean. Their smaller Balkan neighbors are becoming nervous as Austria-Hungary grows stronger, and this may ignite a serious political situation in the middle of Europe.
$Player_desc1890_britain;The {0} is currently the dominant economic and colonial power in the world. Possessing the largest overseas territory grants huge financial resources but is also a great responsibility. The Royal Navy must be constantly maintained and developed at the highest standards to sufficiently protect the overextended borders of the British Empire. A moment of weakness may ignite colonial rebellions or opportunistic attempts against Britain by other powers such as the German Empire which continuously grows in industrial and naval strength. The British Empire, although unrivaled at sea, desperately needs good relations with other powers to maintain her supremacy around the world.
$Player_desc1890_china;The {0} is ruled by the Qing Dynasty from 1636 and, in the last century, faced several civil wars and short conflicts with the major powers, that resulted in loss of territories and a serious economic decline. Yet, the Dynasty achieved to survive and keep the country united. The present situation finds China hardly pressed by other major powers to gain access in her lucrative trade ports. A military conflict could be avoided with diplomatic means, except probably with Japan, which constantly threatens the Korean kingdom, a vital protectorate of China. The Chinese Empire cannot avoid a potential war against Japan from which it must survive to become a considerable naval force.
$Player_desc1890_france;{0} controls at least one colony in each continent of the world. The rich possessions in Africa and Asia provide many opportunities to expand them further in neighboring territories, either politically or by military strength. A strong fleet is required constantly to protect the French overseas waters, but this is risky while Germany and Austro-Hungary rise as major military powers in Central Europe. The mere existence of the French nation is in high danger, if a war emerges which finds the French forces stretched thinly. Thankfully, the relations with traditional enemies such as Britain are in good state, so strong alliances can be forged to strengthen the French defenses.
$Player_desc1890_germany;The {0} was formed in 1871 after the unification of German states and is administered by Kaiser Wilhelm II, an ambitious leader with an extreme interest in naval warfare. The Kaiser is eager to build a fleet, strong enough to threaten the naval supremacy of the British Empire and expand the German colonies around the world. The rapid industrial and population growth of the German homeland pushes naturally to an aggressive policy which concerns the other powers. In combination with the Kaiser’s monarchic rulership it makes diplomatic relations difficult, except maybe with Austro-Hungary or Italy, which appear to share similar motives.
$Player_desc1890_italy;The {0} has been formed quite recently after the complete unification of Italian states in 1871. The Italian Kingdom can barely be called an Empire, since besides the territories of the Italian peninsula, she possesses only a few colonies in east Africa. Italy arrived late in the colonial race of the past decades but has the potential to become a bigger overseas power, under the shadow of the declining Ottoman Empire, and quickly extend its borders in North and East Africa. Italy, though, is geographically situated in a strategic position that could quickly involve her in conflicts with other major powers. Thus, choosing the right ally from the start will greatly determine Italy’s future.
$Player_desc1890_japan;The {0} was formed when Japan became united into one nation under the rulership of the Emperor. This event known as the Meiji Restoration of 1868 ended the shogunate period and opened a new era of rapid Industrialization and technological advancement. From then on, Japan races to catch up with the western powers and prioritizes the building of a strong navy to defend her waters from neighbouring threats, such as the mighty Russian Empire which shares the same expansion ambitions in the areas of Korea and Manchuria. The less modernized Chinese Empire is another dangerous rival that is constantly a reason for hostilities and must not be underestimated.
$Player_desc1890_russia;The {0} enjoys a heavy industrial development fed by the endless natural resources of the vast Russian territories, that expand from eastern Europe to Eastern Asia. The Russian Empire has the potential to become the biggest naval power but faces two main problems. The first one is that the Russian fleets in the Baltic and Black Sea can be easily cut off inside the straits and are too far away to support the Asian waters, allowing other powers, such as Japan to gain superiority with less forces. The second -and biggest problem- is that the majority of the population dislikes the Tsarist government, so the country is constantly facing the threat of a political turmoil that may escalate even to a full rebellion.
$Player_desc1890_spain;The {0} is now only a tiny fraction of what it was in its glorious time. During the 19th century, Spain gradually lost almost all colonial territories in America, Africa and the West Indies which became independent. The remnants of Spanish colonies in the Caribbean and the East Indies, especially Cuba and Philippines, are in constant uprising while the United States are having a suspicious role in all this. Despite being in decline, Spain is a big country with considerable military forces but with a seriously neglected naval infrastructure. Spain must quickly develop a strong fleet in order to face inevitable challenges from which she must survive in order to become rebirthed from her ashes.
$Player_desc1890_usa;The {0} of America has gradually become a mighty industrial power, which can now counter the traditional superpowers of the World. The US Fleet is currently in development, but can quickly become dominant due to the increasing financial growth of the US nation. Moreover, the relatively secured ground borders allow a non-risky expansion policy. The recent collapse of the Spanish Empire in Latin America provides many opportunities to gain control of those territories in a political or military manner. The United States should not be troubled about a potential war with the decadent Spain but must be wary of the increasing rivalry among the great powers and choose wisely its friends and enemies.
$Player_desc1900_japan;The {0} won a decisive victory against the Chinese Empire in their recent swift conflict, making the Japanese fleet the dominant power in Southeast Asia while the Japanese gained a foothold in the Korean peninsula. The next major adversary in the region is the Russian Empire. A major land battle seems unlikely so the only way to defeat them in a potential war is to utilize the fleet effectively. This time period Japan will strive for its existence. A military failure against Russia will either cause a total collapse or raise China’s thirst for another confrontation which may have a different outcome if the Japanese nation is weakened.
$Player_desc1900_spain;The {0} lost the war against the USA in 1898 and as a result it gave possession of the Spanish Philippines, Guam and other small islands to the USA. Several islands which were no longer possible to control were sold to Germany for a small amount. This recent humiliating event is proof that something must be done quickly, at all costs, to strengthen the Spanish Navy, if Spain wishes to protect her few remaining colonies or even protect her mainland against the rising global powers who grow thirstier for expansion.
$Player_desc1900_usa;The {0} had a swift victory in the recent Spanish-American war and gained new territories. The Americans are safe in their mainland, and with a strong navy they can easily protect their waters against any potential adversary. However, expanding further will be very difficult against the current major powers, since it will need a very strong expeditionary naval force which cannot function if there are not nearby supply ports. A wise strategy would be to expand the US control in distant colonies either politically or by force, in order to maintain the opportunity to intervene with determination everywhere around the world.
$Player_desc1910_china;The heavy defeat of the {0} in the Sino-Japanese war brought the Qing Dynasty closer to its complete destruction. The Chinese navy has been disintegrated and the Japanese are continuing to threaten the mainland with a naval invasion while European powers are pressing with continuous humiliating treaties which give them access to the Chinese shores. It would be a miracle if someone managed to revive the Beijing fleet and bring back some order to the Chinese Empire by at least controlling its sea borders.
$Player_desc1910_japan;The {0} has grown larger the last two decades and won two wars against China and Russia. The recent tension between major European powers may cause another military conflict which can bring an opportunity for Japan to expand further and seize valuable colonies. The imperial Japanese Navy has managed to become a recognized force that other major powers would like to have as an ally and not an opponent. Therefore, Japan must wisely pick its allies and enemies in the coming years in order to effectively satisfy its imperialistic plans in the South Pacific.
$Player_desc1910_russia;After the humiliating defeat in the Russo-Japanese war the civil disorder in the {0} has grown to a very dangerous level. The corruption has spread everywhere affecting the economy which is near a collapse. Without enough funds, it is hard to maintain a sufficient navy and a functional army. Russia remains a powerful nation with the potential to find its past glory but needs a careful strategy to slowly overcome the difficulties. Failing to do so will find her diving into turmoil and a revolution which will strip out the aristocracy for good.
$Player_desc1910_spain;European tension rises, and the {0} has not managed to improve its financial status nor its political stability. Building a strong navy, at least sufficient to repel a possible attack from a major power, seems a distant dream. If Spain manages to keep neutrality during the coming years, she may consolidate its forces and gradually become stronger.
$Player_desc1910_usa;The tension in Europe increases and the {0} will soon need to face a difficult challenge. If a war breaks out between the major European nations, should the US intervene and which side should they support? Perhaps this can be a great opportunity to become benefited either strategically or economically. The US navy will play the largest role in a potential future war and this is why it must continue to be developed to the highest standards.
$Player_desc1920_austria;[Speculative] The {0} was totally defeated in the Great War but instead of totally collapsing into smaller fragments of independent nations, it has kept its unity, thanks to the aid of the Allied powers who decided to use Austria-Hungary as a buffer state against the dissatisfied Italy who could later become an enemy. Austria-Hungary is no longer led by monarchs and has a fully parliamentary government. Financially and strategically it appears almost impossible to become a major threat again in Europe although this might change if it manages to follow the past dream, to develop one of the strongest navies in the world which can secure the nation's lands and project its power across the world.
$Player_desc1920_britain;Worldwide economy has deteriorated after the Great War but the {0} remains a colonial superpower and retains the most powerful navy in the world. As an overstretched empire, it will have difficulties to defend all possessions if other nations attempt to defy British authority. The USA, the only nation that benefited economically from the war, seems to remain trustworthy. Older rivals which were defeated in the war, such as Germany, now have neutral relations while old allies, such as the Communistic Russia and the nationalist Japan seem to have chosen an independent imperialistic path which must be handled sensitively. 
$Player_desc1920_china;After the Chinese revolution of 1911 the last ruling Dynasty of China has fallen and the nation is governed for the first time by a socialist democratic party. {0} has a long way to go to improve its economy, infrastructure and the military. China’s enormous population and vast territories make it difficult to control successfully without a large land army. There are currently not enough funds to support a sufficient navy and improve the support of the army logistically, but because the other major powers are either busy fighting each other or recovering from war, there is time for China to gradually become stronger in all aspects.
$Player_desc1920_france;{0} retains her rich colony possessions around the world but the Great War has weakened her economy. Although funds are limited, the French must invest in their navy as it is vital for protecting the overseas territories and keeping them safe against potential threats or rebellions.  Germany remains the largest threat for the French but after their total defeat in the war they have neutral relations and, at least for some time, they cannot become an enemy. This time period can be useful for the French to stabilize their financial and military strength to counter the inevitable difficulties that the next decades may bring.
$Player_desc1920_germany;After {0}’s total defeat in the Great War, Kaiser Wilhelm abdicated as German emperor and the old government was overthrown. Following a swift revolution the newly formed German republic signed the formal surrender to the Allies and humiliating treaties which led to the loss of all colonies, the annexation of mainland territories, and a forced limit in naval and war expenditures. For as long as the other major powers remain in neutral relations with the new German government, it will be safe to slowly grow again into a formidable major power.
$Player_desc1920_italy;The {0} had eventually joined the Allied Powers in the Great War but its territorial gains were considered small in comparison to the war cost for Italy, increasing the social unrest in the country. Relations with other major powers are quite frozen and due to the financial crisis the extreme nationalist political parties rise in strength. One good thing is the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire which no longer is a big threat in the eastern borders of Italy. Thus, there is time to consolidate forces, and develop a navy which can help Italy to satisfy her enduring military goals in Africa and its rich provinces.
$Player_desc1920_japan;The Allies have rewarded the {0} for aiding them in the Great War by granting all the previous German colonies in the South Pacific and Southeast Asia, although the USA had diplomatically tried to prevent this from happening, recognizing Japan as their next naval threat in the Pacific. This was the first incident which seriously deteriorated the relations between Japan and the USA, and marked the progressive diplomatic isolation of Japan from most of the western powers. No matter this, the Empire of Japan now finds a clearer path to extend its borders further into China’s mainland, and around the Pacific. 
$Player_desc1920_russia;Near the end of the Great War, the Russian Empire collapsed due to a  revolution taking place in 1917. A civil war followed which resulted in the independence of old Russian territories, the execution of the royal family and the forming of a new government led by the Communists who now run the country. The {0} is still a nation in turmoil with a fragmented economy, struggling to retain its unity. In such conditions, it is extremely difficult to develop a navy strong enough to rival the other major nations, yet it will be a necessity, for the following years to come.
$Player_desc1920_spain;The {0} remained neutral during the Great War and this was both good and bad. It was good because Spain has not declined further, and still holds its territorial possessions. It was bad because she has never been more isolated from the rest of the major powers. The Spanish Empire, a small set of colonies and a country with various internal political problems will be helpless in case one or more provinces are targeted by a larger foe.
$Player_desc1920_usa;The end of the Great War finds the {0} with an increased economic growth due to the export demand for US products in the wrecked European countries. Moreover, the US fleet is finally up to a standard that can compete even against the British Royal fleet. In this time period of relative peace, the Communist regime in Russia is becoming an annoyance for all the democracies, including the US. Japan is also another potential adversary since they cannot hide their plans in expanding their empire in seas where the US also have their own interests.
$Player_desc1930_britain;Worldwide economy began to stabilize after the Great War but the {0} has slowly declined due to her pacifist policy. Britain lost control of various colonies around the world and the USA is now a financial giant and will soon become the sole superpower in the world. The British naval strength is not yet threatened but is not anymore considered the strongest in the world. Nationalists in Germany continue to increase and if they take the ruleship then Europe will certainly dive into turmoil. The Soviet Union and Japan are also nations which grow their military strength into dangerous levels. Under all those circumstances, the British must take action if they want to survive a next big war.
$Player_desc1930_china;In this time period {0} has a notable industrial growth but also suffers from internal turmoil and local rebellions. The Empire of Japan is lurking to trigger a second Sino-Japanese war by attacking the rich province of Manchuria. If China manages to control her territories while developing its navy in a good state, she may manage to defend successfully against the dangerous Japanese navy and prevent a general invasion to her mainland.
$Player_desc1930_france;{0} retains her rich colony possessions around the world but the Great War has weakened her economy. Although funds are limited, the French must invest in their navy as it is vital for protecting the overseas territories and keeping them safe against potential threats or rebellions. Germany remains the largest threat for the French but after their total defeat in the war they have neutral relations and, at least for some time, they cannot become an enemy. This time period can be useful for the French to stabilize their financial and military strength to counter the inevitable difficulties that the next decades may bring.
$Player_desc1930_germany;The “Weimar Republic”, as it is commonly known, continues to rule {0} but due to the global financial depression and the recent losses of the Great War, nationalist movements gain ground in the German political scene. If the country is led to elections there is a big chance that the Nazi party wins and then it will be uncertain what may come next. The major powers which so far have neutral relations may reconsider their policy against the new government. It is certain that if the German people wish to take back their lands, then this cannot be achieved by peace.
$Player_desc1930_italy;Following the dissatisfaction of the Italian people due to the little gains and large cost of the Great War, the Fascist party of Benito Mussolini has won the elections and he became the prime minister of {0}. With him leading the country, Italy began an expansionist policy, with the goal to increase colonial possessions and expand its global military influence. This is the first spark of a new period of uncertainty and rising tension in Europe. The new regime favors the building of a powerful navy and creates an opportunity for the Italian nation to grow larger at the cost of becoming a target of all democratic powers.
$Player_desc1930_russia;The {0} has survived and managed to remain in authority and maintain the unity of the vast country. The ideas of communism aided to overcome the past difficulties and brought the nation back to a rapid industrial growth, taking advantage of the endless resources of the Russian lands. The development of the navy is not a priority, as it was in the past years, yet as the USSR grows in strength, more naval funds will allow the building of a larger fleet. The enemies of the Soviet Union are not yet clear, as most major nations are involved in other problems of their own. The Russians can utilize this period of time to grow larger and become again a superpower.
$Player_desc1930_usa;The {0} was the most affected nation from the global economic depression that started to spread all over the world in 1929. GDP has fallen dramatically but now it slowly starts to increase again. While the economy is recovering it is advised to keep a functional naval force dedicated for defense and not for offensive operations. If the US becomes involved in a major war, it can lead to a new financial crisis. Tension in Europe starts to increase again and it might be very hard to respond to the new threats that are rising, especially in the East, where Japan continues to grow a large naval force, capable of reaching our shores.
$Player_desc1940_britain;Nazi Germany threatens world peace and influences all nationalist regimes to unite against democratic nations. The {0} is directly threatened by Germany and an inevitable war is approaching. Britain must quickly choose her allies and strengthen her navy, which is the strongest weapon it can use against the war machine of the Nazi’s. Britain must also take into consideration that Italy, Russia and Japan are sympathetic to the Nazi regime and can soon become adversaries. 
$Player_desc1890_portugal;Portugal is currently facing a significant political crisis, marked by the British Ultimatum. The United Kingdom, seeking to expand its control in Africa, is demanding that Portugal abandon its project to unite Angola and Mozambique through the "pink map," which symbolizes Portuguese colonial ambitions to connect its African territories. British pressure is generating a wave of national indignation, weakening the monarchical government, and intensifying republican sentiments. The Empire, now a shadow of its 16th-century glory, struggles with a weakened economy and limited industry, relying on the English to acquire ships to protect its global colonies. The alliance is trembling.
$Player_desc1900_portugal;Portugal is currently experiencing a phase of political instability under its constitutional monarchy. The country is ruled by King Carlos I, but the government frequently changes due to the fragility of political parties and growing popular dissatisfaction. The monarchical regime is under pressure to implement democratic reforms, and there are increasing social and economic tensions.\n\nAt the same time, the Portuguese Navy is in decline. Investment in naval modernization is minimal, leaving the fleet outdated compared to other European powers. Portugal is struggling to maintain its influence over its colonies, particularly in Africa, reflecting the ongoing financial crisis and the lack of resources needed to support a strong, modern navy.
$Player_desc1910_portugal;In 1910, Portugal lived a period of great political instability. The country was under the constitutional monarchy regime, but there was growing popular and political dissatisfaction with the House of Bragança, particularly with King D. Manuel II.

The Greek political landscape is also influenced by the "Great Idea" (Megali Idea), an irredentist concept aiming to expand Greece's territory to include all areas with Greek populations, particularly those under Ottoman rule.
$Player_desc1910_greece;Greece is experiencing a period of significant political and naval transformation. The nation, under the leadership of Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, is undergoing major reforms aimed at modernizing the state and its institutions. Venizelos, a charismatic and progressive leader, is focused on strengthening Greece both domestically and in its regional standing. His government is pushing for constitutional changes, social reforms, and the reorganization of the military to ensure the country is better prepared for potential conflicts.\n\nThe naval situation is particularly critical as Greece is actively engaged in a naval arms race with the Ottoman Empire, reflecting the growing tensions in the region. The Hellenic Navy is being modernized with the acquisition of new warships, which symbolizes Greece's commitment to securing its maritime borders and projecting power in the Aegean Sea. This naval buildup is seen as essential for defending Greek interests and supporting its aspirations in the Balkans, where nationalistic fervor and territorial disputes are on the rise.
$Player_desc1920_greece;Greece is navigating a complex political and naval landscape. The country is emerging from the turbulence of the First World War, where it was aligned with the Allies after much internal strife between pro-German and pro-Allied factions, epitomized by the National Schism. This division, fueled by disagreements between King Constantine I and Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, left Greece politically fragmented.\n\nVenizelos, now a prominent leader, pushes for the realization of the Megali Idea, a vision of expanding Greek territories to include all regions with significant Greek populations, particularly in Asia Minor. This ambition has led to military engagement in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), where Greece is attempting to assert control over these territories.\n\nNavally, Greece is relatively strong, possessing a modern fleet bolstered by acquisitions from the Allied powers. The Hellenic Navy plays a crucial role in securing the Aegean Sea and supporting the military campaigns in Asia Minor. However, the ongoing war strains Greece's resources and creates uncertainty about its future, both domestically and on the international stage. The nation's political divisions and military overreach threaten to destabilize the progress made in recent years, casting a shadow over its ambitions.
$Player_desc1930_greece;Greece is navigating a turbulent political landscape and a complex naval situation. The country is under the rule of Eleftherios Venizelos, a prominent statesman who leads a series of governments focused on stabilizing Greece after the turmoil of the Greco-Turkish War and the Asia Minor Catastrophe.\n\nOn the naval front, Greece is attempting to rebuild and modernize its navy to protect its extensive coastline and numerous islands, critical for national security and regional influence. The Hellenic Navy is being modernized with the acquisition of new ships, to keep pace with the naval forces of neighboring countries like Italy and Turkey. The strategic importance of the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean makes Greece's naval strength a priority, particularly as tensions rise in Europe.
$Player_desc1940_greece;The country, under the authoritarian rule of Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas, finds itself increasingly under pressure as Italy, led by Benito Mussolini, eyes expansion into Greek territory. Greece, maintaining a policy of neutrality, is nonetheless prepared for conflict, with its military and navy on high alert.\n\nThe Greek Navy plays a crucial role in defending the nation's coastline and protecting its maritime interests in the Aegean and Ionian Seas. Tensions peak on October 28, 1940, when Italy issues an ultimatum demanding Greece allow Axis forces to occupy strategic locations. Metaxas's defiant refusal, captured in his famous declaration "Oxi" (No), leads to Italy launching an invasion.
$Player_desc1940_china;{0} is at war with Japan and has lost the crucial province of Manchuria and adjacent territories. The world is in turmoil as nationalist powers grow in strength and threaten the world with a new Great War. China must rely on her own forces to repel the intruders from her lands. This will be a fight for survival against all odds, for the Chinese army and navy.
$Player_desc1940_france;Τhe newly established German Reich, under the rulership of the Nazi regime, borders {0} and is currently a major threat. If the Germans attack then the French can defend with their land army for a while but without a strong navy to support the logistics, the defense will certainly not last for long. Alliances with other major nations are vital for the inevitable upcoming fight for France's survival not only in her mainland but also in her overseas territories around the world as Japan is also a growing naval force which will surely try to grasp a piece from any weakened colony.
$Player_desc1940_germany;Adolf Hitler rose to power and rules the {0} as leader of the Nazi party. The new regime took advantage of the positive economic steps of the last decades and transformed Germany into one of the largest war machines of the world, with a superior land army and a continuously growing navy, disregarding gradually the constraints of old treaties. Some nations are fond of this new German leader, such as Italy, Japan, and even the communist Russia. For the Germans it is now very clear who is the enemy and who can be a friend… for some time. What is difficult to know is what role will the navy play in the upcoming world war.
$Player_desc1940_italy;Most fascist rulers in the world are joining forces, such as the {0} and the German Reich which seem to prepare for a major offensive versus the rest of the European countries. It is a critical moment for the people of Italy to either follow their fascist ruler or oppose him. Unrest is high in Italy but this will not stop its regime from continuing its expansionist plans. The nation has the financial strength to maintain a significant naval force and a strong army but without the full support from its people it can quickly collapse and lose everything that has gained the past years.
$Player_desc1940_japan;The {0} and China are at war and the Japanese are winning by advancing in Manchuria and nearby provinces. The major powers are currently busy in Europe where the Fascist regimes are growing in strength and may ignite a 2nd World War. At this fragile time period, Japan may carefully choose her allies in order to secure the greatest possible territorial gains. It might be risky to become involved in a greater theater of war as trying to fight on multiple fronts may eventually make Japan lose everything.
$Player_desc1940_russia;The {0} grows in strength and was not affected much from the global financial crisis which deteriorated the economy of western nations. The rise of the Nazi party in Germany increases the tension in Europe and probably this is an opportunity for the Russians to involve again seriously into a power game, at the side of the strongest side. Maybe an alliance with the Germans can help to swiftly retake the lost provinces of the Russian Empire. Anybody leading the naval forces of Russia must remain focused in the following years, for what can be the biggest challenge of the Russian nation in its whole history.
$Player_desc1940_spain;In 1936 a civil war erupted in {0} and Francisco Franco was proclaimed the dictator of Spain. This new nationalist government caused Spain to continue her downfall and become even more isolated from the majority of the world’s nations, however, as other nationalist powers are growing, such as the German Reich of Adolf Hitler, there may be an opportunity to forge important alliances that can help to revive the Spanish nation and its navy.
$Player_desc1940_usa;Difficult times approach not only for the {0} but for the whole world. The German Reich, as proclaimed by its leader “Adolf Hitler” threatens to ignite a 2nd World War. The US are currently having indifferent relations with the German regime but soon things may change, as it happened 25 years ago. The biggest problem for the US is the Empire of Japan which has started a war vs China and is expanding in the South Pacific. Japan is sympathetic to the German government and is surely going to become a threat for the American nation, in the near future.

$Stats_desc_acc;Increases base accuracy of main guns. 
$Stats_desc_acc_long;This accuracy bonus increases progressively as range increases and is very useful for long-range fights. 
$Stats_desc_aim;Increases the target acquiring speed of main guns. Locking to target maximizes the accuracy.
$Stats_desc_beam;The width of the hull greatly affects the ship's maneuverability, stability and resistance against hits. A wider hull is a more stable shooting platform and has an increased displacement and resistance but is generally slower, less maneuverable, a larger target and requires significantly more engine horsepower to achieve a reasonable speed.
$Stats_desc_draught;The height of the hull greatly affects the ship's maneuverability, stability and resistance against hits. A taller and consequently a larger hull is a less stable shooting platform but is more resistant against flooding and can carry more load, while the operational range becomes increased by its ability to maintain the cruising speed with less wave resistance.
$Stats_desc_endurance;The *Resistance* of the hull affects the damage received from shell hits and torpedoes, after armor penetration. Additionaly, it applies special slope design that increases the ricochet chances of incoming shells.
$Stats_desc_fcap;The maximum engine horsepower that the funnel and boiler system can support. If engine is not adequately supported, then steam efficiency is reduced and penalties apply to ship speed and acceleration.
$Stats_desc_fire_ex;Towers host specialized personnel and the necessary equipment to support damage control. Water pumping, Fire extinquishment and Ship repairs progress faster while the tower is operational.
$Stats_desc_floatability;*Floatability* affects the impact of flooding on the hull. The higher this number, the less probable to get flooding after a hit and the less slow down due to flooding. Additionally this rating affects how durable is the ship in bad weather (WIP: There can be a small chance of ships receiving damage on sea). Floatability may deteriorate by ship design.
$Stats_desc_funnel;At least one *Funnel* is needed for the proper operation of the ship engine. More funnels improve steam efficiency and thus boost the engine and boiler performance.
$Stats_desc_gun_main;The *Main Guns* are the primary weapons of any ship. The larger their caliber the more destructive their power. If they are inadequately protected, their ammo may ignite and cause incalculable damage to the hull.
$Stats_desc_hull_defects;Extra flaws of the hull which have a negative impact on ship performance. \n\n*Flaws that can be repaired with one or more refits depending on technology and magnitude of the problems*
$Stats_desc_hull_form;*Hull Form* affects ship's acceleration, turning speed and the engine power needed to achieve top speed. Additionally it affects the speed penalty from structural damage. Hull Form effects can be modified by ship design.
$Stats_desc_instability_x;The transverse instability is expressed by the weight distribution in the lateral axis of the ship. Increased instability on that axis results in an increased roll motion of the hull and affects gun accuracy, ship maneuverability and may make the ship more prone to flooding. The hull's base stability reduces those negative effects. Designs with yellow or red warnings will generally have bad seakeeping but maybe this can be compensated by the added firepower of heavy weapons or other useful equipment.
$Stats_desc_instability_xx;Roll motion is affected by the weight distribution, hull design and size of the ship. Adding heavy objects across the beam will increase this motion and affect negatively the gun accuracy and seakeeping of the ship.
$Stats_desc_instability_z;Weight distribution on the longitudinal axis of the ship may cause instability that increases pitch motion of the hull and affects gun accuracy, ship maneuverability and may make the ship more prone to flooding. The hull's base stability reduces those negative effects. Designs with yellow or red warnings will generally have bad seakeeping but maybe this can be compensated by the added firepower of heavy weapons or other useful equipment.
$Stats_desc_instability_zz;Pitch motion is affected by the weight distribution, hull design and size of the ship. Adding heavy objects along the centerline will increase this motion and affect negatively the gun accuracy and seakeeping of the ship.
$Stats_desc_night;WIP
$Stats_desc_overweight;An *Overweight* ship has a higher weight than the designed max. displacement. This negatively affects the ship's performance in various aspects but it may also make the ship more resilient to damage.\n\n*A permanent flaw that cannot be repaired*
$Stats_desc_radio;If this ship takes the role of the flagship, it will provide bonuses to fleet inside a communication radius depended on flag signals or radio telegraphy. The bigger the radius, the more effective the fleet around the flagship.
$Stats_desc_size;Increasing the size signature of the ship makes it more detectable and a bigger target. Adding more objects on the ships, for example towers, turrets etc. increases the target signature. 
$Stats_desc_smoke;Smoke emission from funnels affects tower visibility and ship detection.
$Stats_desc_smoke_exhaust;Smoke exhaustion from funnels affects the steam engine efficiency. If "Funnel Capacity" is not sufficient, penalties apply to acceleration and it may become very hard to reach the designed top speed.
$Stats_desc_spot;(Unused)
$Stats_desc_stability;The higher the *Stability* the more accurate are the guns on high speed and bad weather. Stability is further affected by ship design.
$Stats_desc_torpedo;*Torpedo launchers* may be either "underwater" or "above water". The submerged torpedo launchers are placed underwater and are found in large capital ships. The deck torpedo launchers are placed above water and can have multiple tubes and rotate, providing a larger efficiency. Deck torpedo launchers are usually not placed in capital ships, due to the height of the hull that makes their launching hazardous, as well as the danger of explosion if they are hit by an enemy shell.
$Stats_desc_torpedo_detect;The extra visibility that the tower offers increases the range from which torpedoes can be detected. Further increase is offered by Hydrophone or Sonar equipment installed in the ship.
$Stats_desc_tspot;Spotting boost received from the highest operational tower of the ship. If the towers become destroyed, enemy ships can only be spotted according to their surface visibility.
$Stats_desc_turn;How much speed can be lost at the highest turning rate.
$Stats_desc_underweight;An *Underweight* ship has a lower weight than the designed max. displacement. This has a mixed effect on the ship. It may be more agile and faster but also less resilient to damage. \n\n*A permanent flaw that cannot be repaired*
$Stats_desc_vis;The minimum distance from which the ship becomes visible if observed from sea level and is affected by hull size and objects mounted on it. Enemy ship towers have a spotting boost that increase this visibility distance according to their height.
$Stats_desc_weapon_defects;Defects of guns or torpedo armament.\n\n*Flaws that can be repaired with one or more refits depending on technology and magnitude of the problems*

$techGroup_tooltipaim;The gun fire-control systems are essential for warships, especially for battleships, because they greatly improve the long range accuracy against surface ships, utilizing advanced electrical equipment or rangefinder devices.
$techGroup_tooltiparmor;The naval arms competition urges for the development of a continuously more advanced armor, that is not only stronger but also lighter, thus helping our warships to save weights for more arms and engine machinery.
$techGroup_tooltipengine;The propulsion system consists of engines, boilers and several other parts. Improving their technologies will make your ships faster, safer and cost effective, while the weight saving can be used for other valuable ship assets.
$techGroup_tooltipgun;The main armament of our capital ships is their guns and investing in their technology will make them not only more powerful but will allow our warships to carry more of them. Consequently, by developing larger hulls and more advanced gun layouts we can implement the "All big gun" theory and construct our first dreadnoughts.
$techGroup_tooltiphull;The development of bigger and stronger hulls for all ship classes allows the building of more powerful warships that can carry heavier armament and equipment. Additionally, the continuous improvements in construction methods, not only speeds up the ship building but reduces the possibility of design flaws.
$techGroup_tooltipprojectile;Projectiles technology is divided into two main categories. The first is the shell design which solely improves the shells fired from naval guns. The second is the explosives which not only further enhances the shell effectiveness but increases the damage of torpedoes and mines.
$techGroup_tooltipsubmarine;The submarine is considered the ultimate naval weapon of the next century. When we finish the essential experiments we can then start to develop submarines and enhance their capabilities.
$techGroup_tooltipsurv;The technologies that help our warships to remain afloat in emergency situations are vital, because they increase the survivability of our fleet, especially of our expensive battleships.
$techGroup_tooltiptactics;Our fleet will be much less effective if we have poor crew, bad command and no protective means against submarines and minefields. We can significantly improve our strategic strength by investing in the research of naval tactics.
$techGroup_tooltiptorpedo;Our Destroyers or Submarines are heavily dependent from their torpedo armament. By investing in this technology, we can develop advanced multi-torpedo launchers or more powerful torpedoes.

$technology_desc_armor_quality_1;Compound armor is made from two different layers of steel. The front layer is a hard but brittle iron plate which is made of high-carbon steel. The second layer is made by a more elastic low-carbon, wrought iron plate. This armor is designed to break incoming shells with its front plate, while the second layer keeps the armor integrity intact. These two classes of armor, their comparative value depending largely on the skill with which they were made, were approximately 25% superior to their wrought iron predecessor, that is to say a 10-inch all-steel or compound plate would resist the same striking energy that a 12.6-inch iron plate would withstand.                                                                                                       Note: In N.A.R. 1 inch of penetration is equal to 1 inch of iron armor.
$technology_desc_armor_quality_10;Italian extreme improvement of World War I KC armor, close to the best all-round face-hardened armor ever made. Somewhat lower yield strength than any other improved World War II-era KC and, much like Krupp's own KC armor, a very high surface hardness. These plates are unique in that the Back Layer Thickness Percentage increases with increasing plate thickness, giving a large scaling effect much like U.S. World War II Class "A" armor in thin plates, where it helps them against smaller attacking projectiles and a much smaller scaling effect much like British World War II CA against large-caliber projectiles where scaling would hurt the plate's resistance.
$technology_desc_armor_quality_11;Greatly improved KC-type armor. Thinnest - only 15% hard face plus a 15% transition layer - and softest (only 600 Brinell) cemented layer of any post-1930 cemented face-hardened armor, which made this armor the best of all known face-hardened armors in heavy, battleship-grade thicknesses, though rather mediocre in thin plates for cruiser protection, due to the reduction in the negative effects of scaling from increasing projectile size. This armor employed all of the metallurgical improvements mentioned for the last form of KC n/A, including use of Molybdenum, but here using the maximum possible KC n/A amount of this alloy element (0.4%) - and a constant high content of Nickel and Chromium for all plates and making the face as soft and thin as practical to improve resistance against large projectile. In addition, this form of face-hardened armor had the highest back tensile strength of any face-hardened armor ever used.
$technology_desc_armor_quality_2;In 1889, Schneider introduced nickel into all-steel armor, and with the advent of nickel-steel armor began the complete elimination of compound armor. The nickel greatly increased the strength and toughness of steel. The amount of nickel in the first few examples of nickel-steel armor varied between 2% and 5% but finally settled down to about 4%. At about this same time oil and water quenching were successfully applied to armor plates by Schneider. After forging under a hammer, and annealing, the plate was heated to a tempering heat and its face was then dipped for a short depth in oil, this tempering being followed by a low temperature anneal.These improvements resulted in a further increase of about 5% in the resistance of armor, that is to say, a 10-inch nickel-steel treated plate equaled about 13 inches of iron.
$technology_desc_armor_quality_3;The invention of H. A. Harvey of Newark, N. J., consisted in carburizing (cementing) the face of a steel plate by heating it and holding it to a very high temperature (about that of molten cast iron) for from two to three weeks, with the face to be hardened in intimate contact with a bone charcoal or other carbonaceous compound.The result of this treatment was to raise the carbon content of the face to between 1% and 1.10%, with a gradual reduction in carbon content beneath the surface until the effect of the carburization vanished at a depth of about 1 inch. Later the plate was oil quenched and then water quenched, both operations at a uniform temperature throughout the plate, the result being that the super-carburized face assumed a very hard condition, while the back of the plate was toughened. In other words, the face of the plate was super-hardened because of its higher carbon content.Shortly after the adoption of the Harvey process it was shown that the ballistic quality of a plate could be improved by reforging after cementation. This forging, giving a reduction of from 10% to 15% in thickness, was conducted at a low temperature. Harveyized armor immediately established its superiority over all other types. The improvement amounted to another 15% to 20% increase in resistance, 13 inches of Harvey armor equaling about 15.5 inches of nickel-steel armor.
$technology_desc_armor_quality_4;The initial manufacturing of Krupp armour was very similar to Harveyized armour, however, while the Harvey process generally used nickel-steel, the Krupp process added as much as 1% chromium to the alloy for additional hardness. Also, while Harveyized armour was carburized by heating the steel and placing charcoal on its surface for long periods (often several weeks), Krupp armour went a step further. Instead of inefficiently introducing carbon at the surface with coal, Krupp armour achieved greater depth of carbon cementation by applying carbon-bearing gases (coal gas or acetylene) to the heated steel. Once the carburization process was complete, the metal was then transformed into face hardened steel by rapidly heating the cemented face, allowing the high heat to penetrate 30% to 40% of the steel's depth, then quickly quenching first the superheated side then both sides of the steel with powerful jets of either water or oil. Krupp armour was swiftly adopted by the world's major navies. Ballistic tests showed that 10.2 inches (25.9 cm) of Krupp armour offered the same protection as 12 inches (30.4 cm) of Harvey armour.
$technology_desc_armor_quality_5;Extremely constant face hardness to 25% plate depth, and then a very gradual ski-slope hardness drop-off to the 200 Brinell level at only 18% of the plate's thickness from the back. The plate used a high 0.55% Carbon to ease the hardening process somewhat, but was otherwise of more-or-less standard KC composition. The high Carbon content and the very thick hard face made these plates somewhat brittle. From testing done in the mid 20s on these plates using the newer 14"and 16"sizes of the Midvale Unbreakable projectiles, showed that the projectiles shattered, but the improvement in resistance dropped very steeply with increasing projectile size, a huge scaling effect that completely nullified any ballistic improvements when the 14" projectile size was used and actually resulted in the armor being no better than Harveyized nickel-steel armor against unshattered soft-capped projectiles when the 16" projectile size was used (even with shatter occurring!). The super-thick face, which failed by fracture along surfaces, not by deformation and tearing through a volume as did ductile material, was the culprit.
$technology_desc_armor_quality_6;By the early twentieth century, Krupp armour was rendered obsolete by the development of Krupp cemented armour, an evolved variant of Krupp armour. The manufacturing process remained largely the same with slight changes in the alloy composition: in % of total – carbon 0.35, nickel 3.90, chromium 2.00, manganese 0.35, silicon 0.07, phosphorus 0.025, sulfur 0.020. KCA retained the hardened face of Krupp armour via the application of carbonized gases but also retained a much greater fibrous elasticity on the rear of the plate. This increased elasticity greatly reduced the incidence of spalling and cracking under incoming fire, a valuable quality during long engagements.
$technology_desc_armor_quality_7;When U.S. naval armor again began to be developed and manufactured for new ships and for rebuilding older battleships, the lack of ability to cause enough damage to the improved U.S. hard-capped armor-piercing projectiles being developed and introduced continuously was well known, so the trend was to increase the face depth to increase the damage-causing ability of the Class A armor, which was already undergoing a major improvement by the increase in toughness due to better metallurgical skill in general. Unfortunately, U.S. armor-piercing projectiles just kept getting better and better, so the face thickness just kept getting thicker and thicker, until a average of about 55% of the plate was face and transition layers (35-40% face and 15-20% transition layer). The thick face added to the scaling effect, making thick U.S. Class A armor somewhat inferior to German KC n/A or British CA but also working in reverse so that U.S. World War II Class A armor 7" (17.78cm) or less in thickness was the best face-hardened armor used by anyone ever.
$technology_desc_armor_quality_8;Japan solution to replace an equal amount of Nickel due to shortages by copper (0.15%) A technique of using homogeneous armor plates (Krupp non-cemented armor) alongside face hardened armor (Krupp cemented armor). The high Carbon content (0.5-0.55%) was the highest used by a successful homogeneous armor and equaled the highest used for any other mostly-successful face-hardened armor - pre-World War I U.S. Midvale non-cemented face-hardened armor. This high Carbon content allowed easier heat treatments to obtain a given level of hardness, but caused the plates to be somewhat brittle, though no worse than the World War I-era armor that they replaced. This armor was kept at about the same quality level as its British-developed predecessor, making it slightly inferior to most World War II foreign homogeneous armors.
$technology_desc_armor_quality_9;Thick-Plate Improved Krupp Cemented form of Krupp cemented (KC) face-hardened armor for plates with a large perentage (0.4-0.5% by weight) of Molybdenum added, the amount of Chromium increased slightly, the amount of Phosphorus and Sulfur allowed reduced slightly, the amount of Silicon used increased considerably, and the amount of Nickel used decreased to only half what was used previously. The composition of the thicker plates is very similar to most foreign post-1930 face-hardened armors, other than in their usually-different Molybdenum percentage. In addition, this form of KC n/A was finally toughened enough to shatter soft-capped APC and Hooded Common projectiles at low obliquity, as could World War II U.S. and British face-hardened armors.

$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_1;Ammo storage for Shell Rounds takes less space, so less ammunition can be carried. The benefits are, reduced costs, reduced weight and less vulnerability to detonation.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_10;Trinitrotoluene (British Trotyl, French Tolite, Japanese Type 94 Explosive, etc...), is the new standard of high explosive materials. TNT-filled armor-piercing shells are less sensitive than other explosive charges and detonate with higher chance after penetrating the armor, thus expending most of their energy efficiently. Additionally, the TNT propellant is highly resistant to moisture therefore is preserved safe with lighter storage equipment than other propellants. Widely used commercial and military explosive (used by itself and in many mixtures). This explosive was so widely used that it became the "Standard" high explosive that everyone measured all other explosives against, even nuclear explosions are in megatons of TNT.                                                                                                                                                            NOTE: IN NAR, TNT have a "0" shell damage modifier, since is the standard used for comparison. 
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_11;Otherwise known as “Explosive D” or “Ammonium Picrate”, it is a high explosive charge with special armor piercing capabilities because it rarely detonates on impact but needs a fuse to ignite. Ammonium picrate is a salt formed by reacting picric acid and ammonia and is chemically related to TNT but is significantly more unstable in storage conditions.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_12;Amatol is a highly explosive material made from a mixture of TNT and ammonium nitrate. The British name originates from the words ammonium and toluene (the precursor of TNT). Similar mixtures (one part dinitronaphthalene and seven parts ammonium nitrate) were known as Schneiderite in France. Amatol was used extensively during World War I and World War II, typically as an explosive in military weapons such as aircraft bombs, shells, depth charges, and naval mines. Amatol exploits synergy between TNT and ammonium nitrate. TNT has higher explosive velocity and brisance, but is deficient in oxygen. Oxygen deficiency causes black smoke residue from a pure TNT explosion. The oxygen surplus of ammonium nitrate increases the energy release of TNT during detonation. Depending on the ratio of ingredients used, amatol leaves a residue of white or grey smoke after detonation. Amatol has a lower explosive velocity and correspondingly lower brisance than TNT but is cheaper because of the lower cost of ammonium nitrate. 
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_13;(US Tridite) Is an explosive mixture of picric acid and dinitrophenol or picric acid and hexanitrodiphenylamine in a ratio of 70/30. It was typically used as a filling in Royal Navy armour-piercing shells during the early part of the 20th century. Shellite originated after World War I as a development of lyddite (picric acid). During the war, lyddite-filled, armour-piercing shells had been found to be shock-sensitive, with a tendency to prematurely detonate upon impact rather than after penetrating the target's armour plate. Shellite was less sensitive, and also had the advantage of a low melting point, that allowed it to be easily melted and poured into shell casings during manufacture.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_14;Tetrytol is a high explosive, comprising a mixture of tetryl and TNT. Typically, the proportion of ingredients (by weight) is 65%, 70%, 75% or 80% tetryl to 35%, 30%, 25% or 20% TNT. Tetryl and TNT do form a eutectic with a setting point of 67.5 °C, which consists of 55% tetryl and 45% TNT. Hence, cast tetrytol charges consist of solidified suspensions of crystalline tetryl in the solid tetryl-TNT-eutectic. Tetrytol is more sensitive than TNT and less sensitive than tetryl to impact. The detonation velocity of unconfined cast cylindrical charges (1 inch diameter) of tetrytol is between 7290 and 7410 m/s with an average of 7350 m/s for tetrytol 75/25 and 7340 m/s for tetrytol 65/35.For comparison, cylindrical charges of cast pure TNT of similar dimensions are reported to detonate with a velocity of between 6680 and 6990 m/s 
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_15;German and Japanese naval military explosive, originally developed by Germany for mines and torpedoes, but in 1931 also adopted by Japan to replace Shimose in its new Type 91 AP shells, since they finally were forced to give up on using Shimose against heavy face-hardened armor due to its sensitivity to shock (which the British and French had recognized much earlier during WWI) but the Japanese still wanted an explosive similar in power (about 105% of TNT). Highly toxic, so only the Japanese widely used this explosive after WWI. TNA was almost as sensitive as Shimose, but could barely be cushioned enough to remain inert when 33-40% of the cavity was used as a jacket surrounding the actual filler, with a thick plaster case all around the TNA and a thick wood and aluminum cushion filling the upper end of the cavity.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_16;Also known as Hexotol and Hexolite (among others), is a high explosive consisting of castable mixtures of RDX and TNT. It is used as the main explosive filling in artillery projectiles, rockets, land mines, hand grenades and various other munitions. It was also used for the explosive lenses in the first implosion-type nuclear weapons developed by the United States. The standard proportions of ingredients are 59.5% RDX (detonation velocity of 8,750 m/s) and 39.5% TNT (detonation velocity of 6,900 m/s), phlegmatized with 1% paraffin wax. Most commonly it is described as 60/40 RDX/TNT with 1% wax added. 
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_17;Similar to black powder, but is chemically differentiated to provide slower burn rates and therefore function as a propellant. Large quantities of powder are needed to provide a decent shell range, making the ammunition heavier.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_18;"White Powder".The first "smokeless powder" propellant was invented by the French chemist Paul Vielle in 1884 and adopted by the Navy around 1890. Known as Poudre B (for poudre Blanche, meaning "white powder" and also known as poudre Boulanger marine after the Minister of War, General Georges-Ernest Boulanger), this was a single-base propellant composed primarily of nitrocellulose. This early French nitrocellulose was susceptible to spontaneous ignition, and is believed have caused the loss of the battleships Liberté and Iéna, but this propellant was improved by the addition of diphenylamine as a stabilizer and by more careful attention to the pulping and cleaning process to remove residual traces of acid. The French continued to use single-base nitrocellulose in a strip form for most of their weapons up to World War II.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_19;A Double-Base smokeless propellant made from two high explosives, nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine increases the range and muzzle velocity of shells. It is a more powerful propellant than White Powder and relatively safer but becomes highly unstable when ignited, therefore it is riskier to store in a ship. With the Ballistite propellant, the shell trajectories can become exceptionally flat at all ranges, improving the penetration strength against heavy side armor, however the increased gun erosion affects negatively the gun accuracy.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_2;Ammo storage for Shell Rounds can receive the standard amount of ammo.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_20;Cordite is manufactured in a thin cylindrical or cord form and is classified as a low explosive, therefore ideal to use as a propellant. It burns slower than Ballistite but its energy release provides higher shell ranges making them more impactful at their collision angles. The weight of the ammunition becomes larger due to the shape and weight of the cords needed to provide the necessary muzzle velocity. Despite its advantages, Cordite is a highly unstable material, prone to flash fires and it causes high gun erosion which affects accuracy.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_21;An improved version of Cordite which is slightly less powerful as a propellant but safer to use. Shells though become slightly heavier and slower. Cordite offers increased damage and effective shell trajectories for penetrating deck armor, but remains a risky propellant to store in a lightly protected ship.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_22;"Tube Powder". An advanced smokeless propellant similar to the Cordite which is also known as RP (Rohr-Pulver). It has the form of small tubes and offers maximum safety in storage conditions. Due to being a low explosive, shell muzzle velocity and range is decreased. Combining this propellant with light shells, you can preserve effective shell penetration power with a reduced weight and increased safety for your ship, while the reduced gun barrel erosion affects positively the base gun accuracy, albeit at shorter ranges.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_23;This new single base propellant was first produced in 1908 and adopted as the standard propellant formulation by US navy at 1912. SPD was found to have good stability characteristics when properly stored, with some lots manufactured prior to World War I staying in storage for as long as twelve years without loss of stability. During World War II, the primary USN propellant was SPD in a multi-tube form made up of 99.5% nitrocellulose (12.6% N), 0.5% diphenylamine. The USN used a flat, short cylindrical grain design that usually had seven perforations with the websize varying from 0.023 in (0.58 mm) for the short 3 in (7.62 cm) gun to about 0.174 in (4.42 mm) for the 16 in (40.64 cm) guns. SPD had a good safety record partly due to the harder-to-ignite and slow burning nature of its single-base nature and partly due to the quality of its manufacturing process.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_24;A more stable version of Cordite propellant with characteristics very similar to the "Tube Powder" type. It is equivalent to the British solventless Cordite SC propellant and offers exceptional shell characteristics in terms of damage and ballistics, while it is relativately safe for a ship that is well protected trough the addition of stabilizers.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_25;The safest version of the "Tube Powder" propellant. It is though significantly heavy, making the ammunition additionally heavier and the shells to travel at shorter ranges.The previous versions used nitroglycerin while the new RP C/38 used diethylene glycol dinitrate (DGN), which was cooler-burning and less bore erosive improving accuracy.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_26;An important development during World War II was the addition of another explosive, nitroguanidine, to the mixture to form triple-base propellant or Cordite N. This solved two problems with the large naval guns of the day as fitted to capital ships. Nitroguanidine produces large amounts of nitrogen when heated, which had the benefit of reducing the muzzle flash and its lower burning temperature greatly reduced the erosion of the gun barrel and improving the accuracy. Other additives were added which improve the chemical stability.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_27;Improved triple base propellants, compromised by three chemical substances have more detonation velocity and are safer for shipboard magazine storage.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_28;Using crude TNT and some other compounds such as ammonium nitrate, ammonal, schneiderite and amatol the explosive charge becomes more powerful and stable.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_29;A new chemical substance increases the duration of smoke screen generation.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_3;Ammo storage for Shell Rounds becomes maximum, so more ammunition can be carried. The downside is, increased costs, increased weight and more vulnerability to detonation.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_37;The chance for a torpedo to actually explode on target increases.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_4;Ammo storage for Torpedo Rounds takes less space, so less ammunition can be carried. The benefits are, reduced costs, reduced weight and less vulnerability to detonation.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_43;Our mines become more lethal against all types of enemy ships.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_5;Ammo storage for Torpedo Rounds can receive the standard amount of ammo.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_6;Ammo storage for Torpedo Rounds becomes maximum, so more ammunition can be carried. The downside is, increased costs, increased weight and more vulnerability to detonation.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_7;This is the earliest form of explosive and can still be used in naval gunnery. Classified as a "Low Explosive" it needs an increased amount of explosive material to function sufficiently as an explosive charge. Therefore shells are made a bit heavier while the magazines must be considerably enlarged to contain the numerous powder shacks. 10% Sulfur/15% Charcoal/75% Potassium Nitrate (Saltpeter) finely ground and mixed together in some water to form a thick paste, which was thoroughly dried and then ground again into a black powder black mixture that burns so extremely fast that when tightly confined so that the pressure inside the mixture can get high enough, it would provide a rather low-power (by current explosive standards) explosion, not a detonation, as with later "high" explosives like Nitroglycerine and its successors. The sulfur and charcoal provided the fuel and the Potassium nitrate provided the oxidants (oxygen and nitrogen) that it burned with, no outside fuel or air required. The limitation here was that the fuel portion was not an explosive by itself and not chemically part of the oxidant-supplier, so the potassium nitrate could just make it burn very fast, never truly detonate, that is, never create a supersonic shockwave in the explosive to drastically increase the burn rate and do much more damage to the surrounding area.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_8;Nitrocellulose or "Gun Cotton". This low-power explosive, somewhat more powerful than Black Powder, was the first in the chemical series that quickly created the high (detonable) explosives Nitroglycerine and its many successors. It was simply finely shredded wood pulp free of any impurities (so that it was much like white cotton, hence its nickname) that was soaked into hydrochloric acid until it was a thick white paste, with the acid then washed away by pure water and some small amounts of chemicals added to soak up any residue acid to keep the powder chemically stable (this turned out to be rather difficult to get right and unstable powder caused many disasters). It could be used much like black powder in guns, but could be made to burn more slowly, allowing improved gun designs with higher muzzle velocities to be developed (long-barrel breech-loading rifled cannons). Used primarily as a gun propellant replacing Black Powder, it was used by itself (single-based powder, as used by the US and French Navies) or, more widely, mixed with Nitroglycerine for added power (smaller size of charge needed for a given gun muzzle velocity, the most famous being British Cordite).
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_9;A super high explosive mainly composed from picric acid equivalent to the British “Lyddite”, the French “Melinite”, the Japanese “Shimose Powder'', the Austro-Hungarian “Ecrasite” or other names. It is an ultra powerful explosive charge but highly sensitive, causing shells to often detonate upon impact before penetrating the armor. HE shells filled with that explosive can be very effective against lightly armored targets or cause endless fires to heavily armored ships.
$technology_desc_projectile_explosive_end;Shell explosives become safer to use in storage but also more powerful.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_11;Lighter shells have better accuracy at low ranges due to higher muzzle velocity, trajectory flattening and reduced time to target.\nThese shells have less momentum to overcome surface irregularities and tend to deflect more easily upon impact.\nQuicker to reload, cheaper, are also safer to use and storage.\nHave low penetration and reduced damaged due to low mass and smaller bursting charge.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_12;Shells with default ballistic properties according to technology.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_13;Heavy shells have better range and are more accurate at long ranges due to improved ballistic coefficient, that is a measure of how well a projectile retains its velocity and resists drag as it travels through the air.\nThese shells tend to penetrate surfaces rather than bouncing off, due to their greater mass and momentum.\nSlower to reload, expensive, are also more dangerous to use and storage.\nHave improved penetration and damaged due to higher mass and bigger bursting charge.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_14;Super heavy shells have the best range and are the most accurate at long ranges due to better ballistic coefficient, that is a measure of how well a projectile retains its velocity and resists drag as it travels through the air.\nThese shells, possess more mass, resulting in higher momentum, improving the capability to penetrate armor.\nIt is the slowest to reload, incredible expensive and are also the most dangerous to use and storage.\nHave the best penetration and damaged due to the highest mass and biggest bursting charge.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_15;The shape of the shell nose is aerodynamically improved providing greater range and penetration power.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_16;Better designed shells which have more aerodynamic shape offer greater range and penetration power.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_17;High explosive shells can carry more explosive charge due to the thinner and durable shell cases.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_18;With the new fuse technology the shells will not prematurely detonate so they can penetrate the armor more. Additionally the shells are more stable in storage conditions.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_19;The usage of high tensile steel allows the construction of thinner shells which can carry more explosives.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_20;A variant of a High Capacity HE shell which adds a mixture in the bursting charge that makes it especially incendiary. The shell is very light with little penetrating ability and is designed to explode on impact making it effective for incapacitating destroyers and other light warships, or cause endless fires to a heavily armored battleship.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_21;High Capacity HE shells (HCHE) have thinner walls to carry more explosive charge and thus are lethal against lightly armored ships. The short-delay fuze in most cases will cause the shell to detonate immediately on impact, so these shells are not expected to penetrate thick armor but to destroy the surface of a ship.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_22;A Common Nose Fuse (CNF) High Explosive shell has the percussion fuze located at the nose of the shell. The short delay fuse is designed to cause the detonation of the shell almost at the time of impact, reducing its penetration effect but increasing its incendiary capability as the shell has more chances to explode into smaller fragments and damage the ship's surface. The explosive filling and weight of CNF shells is increased compared to CP.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_23;Common Pointed (CP) shells have a solid nose and a percussion fuze on the base of a shell delaying the detonation upon impact and thus increasing the chance of penetrating a ship's steel protection before exploding. The shell’s thin walls allow inside a higher load of explosive, compared to an AP shell that is heavier and denser.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_24;A Common Pointed shell which has an extra soft cap on the nose which helps it to penetrate further into a steel plate before detonating. A CPC shell has a higher penetrating power than a typical HE shell but carries a slightly lighter bursting charge.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_25;An improved CPC shell which has an specially designed ballistic cap which is of a soft and light material that improves ballistics and penetration power of the shell. The shell is denser and heavier and carries less bursting charge than a typical HE round.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_26;Semi armor piercing shells carry a higher explosive payload due to the medium thickness of the shell walls. Their fuze has a medium delay and as a result they are still capable of penetrating heavy armor up to a certain extent and when they do, they have a more destructive effect. These shells might be highly ineffective against heavily armored battleships, but devastating against lightly armored warships.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_33;Semi armor piercing equipped with a soft cap, to improve penetration, mainly at low angles. Similarly as the SAP shell, it has a medium delay fuze and carries more bursting charge than a typical AP round.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_27;Ballistic cap allow the cap underneath to have a less aerodynamic shape that provides greater penetration power at steep angles. Similarly as the SAP and SAPC shell, it has a medium delay fuze and carries more bursting charge than a typical AP round. Its penetration power is improved to be a threat for any warship except the most heavily armored battleships.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_28;A typical Armor Piercing shell has a specially hardened and shaped nose, thick walls and dense material to increase the ballistic properties and penetration power of the shell. The percussion fuze is located in the nose and has a delaying mechanism to detonate the shell after penetrating deep inside the steel protection of a warship.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_29;Against the face-hardened armor which can cause shells to shutter upon impact, the new armor piercing shells are designed to have a solid iron or steel cap at their tip making them more effective in armor penetration. The heavier and denser shell is having a slightly reduced bursting charge as a side-effect.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_30;Ballistic cap allow the cap underneath to have a less aerodynamic shape often with sharp edges, which allows it to grip into armour even at high impact angles. The shell is slightly heavier and has a reduced bursting charge.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_31;An enhanced armor piercing cap increases the chances of the shell to pierce the armor and cause internal damage to an enemy ship. This type of shell is more effective against heavily armored ships.
$technology_desc_projectile_shell_32;The construction material of shells is further improved, improving their ballistics and the explosive payload they can carry.
$technology_desc_sub_surv_1;The submarine's hull receives some outer modules, like the ballast tanks which enhance its surface and diving speed.

$technology_desc_sub_surv_29;The submarine's diesel engine powers a generator that can either charge the submarine's batteries or drive the electric motor. This system allows the submarine to use the more silent electric motor in both surface and submerged mode.
$technology_desc_sub_surv_3;A double hull structure reduces the noise coming from submarine's internal operations and increases its survivability against water pressure and depth charges.
$technology_desc_sub_surv_35;The snorkel is a device which allows submarines to run on diesel engines even when underwater, albeit at slower speed. This is simply a tube which extends above sea level while the submarine is submerged. The tube consists of an intake and exhaust pipe, where outside air is drawn into the submarine, and exhaust gases are expelled from the exhaust pipe.
$technology_desc_sub_surv_36;The previous snorkel was prone to malfunctions because it was raised and lowered with an arm-mechanism that could not be operated manually. The telescopic snorkel is extended and retracted vertically, much like a periscope, and can be operated by hydraulics or manually by hand.
$technology_desc_sub_surv_37;An advanced snorkel mechanism which does not restrict the submarine's speed further improves the ability of the submarine to travel submerged while using its more powerful diesel engines.
$technology_desc_sub_surv_4;Between the Light Hull (the external hull which determines the shape of submarine) and the Pressure Hull (the stronger part of the hull which withstands the outside pressure and has normal atmospheric pressure inside) there is an extra pressure hull which contains the steering equipment and the armament.
$technology_desc_sub_surv_5;Three or more pressure hulls increase the submarine's hull strength and stealth capability.
$technology_desc_sub_surv_6;An improved shape of a submarine hull for minimum drag is found with a parabolic bow and an elliptical stern.

$tooltip_armor_belt;*Main Belt* armor covers the warship from the sides, starting from the main deck down to some distance below the waterline. The belt armor prevents shells or torpedoes from penetrating horizontally to the heart of the hull and causing catastrophic internal damage.
$tooltip_armor_belt_bow;*Fore Belt* armor is the extension of the belt armor on the bow of the ship. It does not have to be as thick as the belt because projectiles that strike from the front are more easily deflected due to the angle of impact.
$tooltip_armor_belt_stern;*Aft Belt* armor is the extension of the belt armor on the stern of the ship. It does not have to be as thick as the belt because projectiles that strike from the rear are more easily deflected due to the angle of impact.
$tooltip_armor_bulkheads;*Bulkheads armor* is very expensive and heavy but is valuable, especially on capital ships. Penetrating shells hit their extra protective layer, reducing significantly the final damage on hull sections below the waterline.
$tooltip_armor_deck;*Main Deck* covers the warship’s deck surface and protects against long-range plunging fire that can cause devastating damage to the ship’s citadel.
$tooltip_armor_deck_bow;*Fore Deck* armor expands the deck armor on the bow, protecting the ship against plunging fire received from the front.
$tooltip_armor_deck_stern;*Aft Deck* armor expands the deck armor on the stern, protecting the ship against plunging fire received from the rear.
$tooltip_armor_diameter;The gun barrel *diameter* affects all the characteristics of the gun and most importantly the range, accuracy, damage and penetration capabilities. Increasing the barrel’s diameter inevitably increases the turret’s size so the armor and steel construction weight and cost can increase considerably. By adjusting the diameter of the gun it is possible to find an optimal gun performance and at the same time keep the weight and cost of the ship at a desirable setting.
$tooltip_armor_inner_belt_1st;Behind the Main Belt there is an extra protective steel layer which reduces the destructive power of a penetrating shell. If no armor is used, then there is still some protection offered according to the Citadel type.\n\n*At least 50%* of the shell's penetrating power is lost before hitting this layer.
$tooltip_armor_inner_belt_2nd;Behind the Main Belt and the 1st Inner Belt armor there is another protective steel deck which further reduces the destructive power of a penetrating shell. If no armor is used, then there is still some protection offered according to the Citadel type.\n\n*At least 75%* of the shell's penetrating power is lost before hitting this layer.
$tooltip_armor_inner_belt_3rd;The last resort of defense against shell hits at the side of the ship. A penetrating shell loses most of its momentum by passing through the previous layers of armor and can be stopped at this level, without detonating inside the engine rooms or ammo storages. If no armor is used, then there is still some protection offered according to the Citadel type.\n\n*At least 90%* of the shell's penetrating power is lost before hitting this layer.
$tooltip_armor_inner_deck_1st;Below the Main Deck there is an extra protective steel layer which reduces the destructive power of a penetrating shell. If no armor is used, then there is still some protection offered according to the Citadel type.\n\n*At least 50%* of the shell's penetrating power is lost before hitting this layer.
$tooltip_armor_inner_deck_2nd;Below the Main Deck and the 1st Inner Deck armor there is another protective steel deck which further reduces the destructive power of a penetrating shell. If no armor is used, then there is still some protection offered according to the Citadel type.\n\n*At least 75%* of the shell's penetrating power is lost before hitting this layer.
$tooltip_armor_inner_deck_3rd;The last resort of defense against plunging shell hits. A penetrating shell loses most of its momentum by passing through the previous layers of armor and can be stopped at this level, without detonating inside the engine rooms or ammo storages. If no armor is used, then there is still some protection offered according to the Citadel type.\n\n*At least 90%* of the shell's penetrating power is lost before hitting this layer.
$tooltip_armor_length;The gun barrel *length* affects the length of the gun rifle. A longer rifle increases the shell’s range and muzzle velocity, thus its penetration capabilities. A longer rifle also increases the cost and weight of the gun while it decreases its fire rate. Guns with shorter rifles have a significant fire rate bonus and are also considerably cheaper and lighter.
$tooltip_armor_secondaries;The *Secondaries* armor shields all other guns except main guns protecting them from becoming incapacitated.
$tooltip_armor_superstructure;The *Superstructure* armor is usually much lower than the Conning Tower armor and affects the steel protection of towers and funnels. If towers or funnels are destroyed during battle then all their respective effects become non-functional.
$tooltip_armor_turret;*Turret Side* armor shields the guns against horizontal shell hits, usually inflicted from short and medium distance. Turret armor is typically very strong for the battleships' main guns because not only they are their most important weaponry but also because there would be an extreme danger of a catastrophic detonation of their ammo storage after a full penetrating hit.
$tooltip_armor_turret_barbette;Guns of caliber 5-inch or higher have an internal extra protection, a circular armored steel construction which begins from the inside of the turret and continues down below the sections where the reload mechanisms and ammunition are stored. When the *Barbette* is penetrated then a catastrophic ammo detonation may occur or a flash fire in case a fire enters the ammunition chamber.
$tooltip_armor_turret_casemates;*Casemates* armor protection is the armor plates sealing the casemate guns from the sides and top.
$tooltip_armor_turret_main_guns;The *Main guns* armor covers each turret horizontally (sides) and vertically (top).
$tooltip_armor_turret_secondaries;The *Secondary Guns* armor covers each turret horizontally (sides) and vertically (top).
$tooltip_armor_turret_top;*Turret Top* armor protects the guns against plunging shell hits that are regularly inflicted from long range fire. Shells that penetrate the turrets from above may cause a catastrophic explosion of their ammo storage.

$tooltip_campaign_build_shipyard;Increasing your shipyard development size allows you to design and build larger warships. Hulls you research will not be available if the shipyard development is not sufficient.
$tooltip_campaign_cancel_shipyard;While the shipyard is under development you may cancel it in order to make financial savings. However you will lose a part of the construction done so far.
$tooltip_campaign_crew_training;“Crew Training” funds increase the monthly addition of new recruits in the crew pool. Furthemore, these funds will help increase the training level of the crew pool and the crew assigned to ships each month up to “Trained” level (Higher rating is achieved only via combat experience or a special tech). Lack of funds will lead to the gradual deterioration of training for your ships’ crew if they are not seeing combat.
$tooltip_campaign_fleet_add_crew;If this option is enabled, ships’ crew is automatically replenished at the start of next turn, depending on reserves of the crew pool. If a ship has less than 70% of its needed crew ("Low Crew" state) it cannot be fully functional and cannot participate in missions. You will have to increase its crew to make the ship functional again.

$tooltip_campaign_fleet_header_crew;The amount of crew currently on board the ship.
$tooltip_campaign_fleet_header_crew_action;Manually adjust the amount of crew for your ships. If there is not enough crew to spare, you might need to take crew from other ships in order to fill up a ship of higher priority.
$tooltip_campaign_fleet_header_damage;The damage of ships measured in percentage. 0% means no damage and maximum is 100% damage which means that the ship is destroyed.
$tooltip_campaign_fleet_header_date;The design year of the ship, which determines the technologies applied when it was constructed.
$tooltip_campaign_fleet_header_fuel;Fuel is dependent on the operational range of the ship. If it becomes "Low" then speed penalties apply in combat and map movement while the maintenance increases.

The “Sea Control” increases the maintenance of the ships and orders them to interact at the largest possible range. More roles can be used when ships are at sea.
$tooltip_campaign_fleet_header_sold;Indicates on which nations the ships are sold. When these ships are finished they are automatically transferred to the customer nation. If you cancel the sale, the ships become yours and can be controlled like all others, but this will negatively affect the relations with the nation that originally ordered them.
$tooltip_campaign_fleet_header_status;The submarines can be at sea, participate in battles, be in  repairs or under construction.
$tooltip_campaign_fleet_header_tonnage;The ships' displacement.
$tooltip_campaign_fleet_header_type;Click to arrange the ships according to their type.
$tooltip_campaign_fleet_header_weapons;Number of main turrets and their caliber, number of torpedo tubes.
$tooltip_campaign_fleet_scrap;Select a ship and press “Scrap” to completely remove it from your fleet list. This action helps to remove obsolete ships and use their crew for newer more powerful ships. Scrapping also provides a small amount of profit, according to ship’s displacement.
$tooltip_campaign_fleet_suspend;Select a ship under construction and enable “Suspend” to pause its building. This action might help to manage your monthly expenses, if they increase too much.
$tooltip_campaign_new_game_ai_opponent;When you choose “Historical AI” the opponent Admiralty Leader will use strategy & tactics based on historical facts. Otherwise, the AI will be a random personality and will behave unexpectedly.
$tooltip_campaign_new_game_difficulty;The AI has bonus in income and technology at higher difficulties than "Normal".
$tooltip_campaign_new_game_fleet_creation;Choose "Fleet: Auto-Generated" to have your initial fleet created automatically. Choose "Fleet: Create Own" to design and build your custom initial fleet.
$tooltip_campaign_new_game_year;Choose the initial year of the campaign. The initial ships' technology will be set at the respective level.
$tooltip_campaign_politic_window_army_force;The active land army which is currently ready to fight. When tension rises the army force increases and also its upkeep cost.\n\nDuring war the conscription level gradually increases making the land army very expensive to maintain, affecting significantly the GDP and the available naval funds.
$tooltip_campaign_politic_window_army_logistics;The army logistics is a factor affecting the supply of your army and is depended heavily on the fleet’s ability to protect the supply routes. If the transport capacity and navy’s power are reduced then the army will become dysfunctional and will not be effective in land combat.\n\nAdditionally, army logistics are dependent on the number of controlled provinces and their population. A nation which is overextended, possessing many colonies and conquered territories, will need a considerably large navy to keep army logistics at a high level.
$tooltip_campaign_politic_window_home_population;The population of Nation's home provinces.
$tooltip_campaign_politic_window_oil_info;Oil resources boost the economy in various ways and also affect the fuel dependency of the fleets. If there is no direct access to oil resources then ships with oil fuel are significantly more expensive to maintain and the fuel takes longer to replenish.
$tooltip_campaign_politic_window_other_population;Population of distant colonies or other conquered provinces.
$tooltip_campaign_research_priorities;Assign a priority to a technology category in order to focus on this research and reduce the time needed to achieve a breakthrough at the expense of slowing down the research of other technologies. \n\nClick the priority icon on your preferred technology to enable/disable it. Up to three priorities can be used.
$tooltip_campaign_shipbuilding_capacity;The port capacity of the home provinces affects the size of domestic shipyards and their capability to support the construction of warships. The larger the home port capacity the larger is the shipbuilding capacity of a nation.\n\nWhen the shipbuilding capacity becomes exceeded due to simultaneous building of many ships, then the construction rate decreases resulting in severe production delays and increased construction costs. In that case, it is advised to at least suspend the construction of some ships to speed up the building of the rest of the warships.
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_area;In which sea region your submarine is situated (Double click to zoom at the map location).
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_attack;Determines the damage that can be inflicted to enemies.
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_crew;The amount of crew currently on board.
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_damage;The damage measured in percentage. 0% means no damage and maximum is 100% damage which means that the submarine is destroyed.
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_date;The design year of the submarine, which determines the technologies applied when it was constructed.
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_fuel;Fuel is dependent on tthe submarine's range. If it becomes "Low" then speed penalties apply in combat and map movement while the maintenance increases.
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_hull_strength;The main factor that protects the submarine from receiving critical damage after being detected.
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_name;You can rename the submarines by double-clicking their name and adding your own text.
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_range;Submarines can only travel at a distance depended from the nearest port and the submarine's range. For example, a coastal submarine with small range, will only be able to travel and create missions at short distances around its port or move to another nearby port. A larger cruiser submarine will have a much less restricted operational radius. The range also determines the attack radius of the submarine group. Submarines attack only enemies included in this relatively small attack radius.
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_role;The *Defend* role is automatically assigned to submarines that stay in port. Submarines that are at sea can switch to more offensive roles.
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_speed;Determines not only the speed that the submarine travels on map (how many turns it needs to reach a point) but also contributes significantly to all its combat actions. For example, a slow submarine will escape unharmed with much smaller chance, or a fast submarine has less chances to become detected provided that it has a high stealth rating.
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_status;The submarines can be at sea, participate in battles,  repair or under construction.
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_stealth;Determines the chance of becoming detected by enemies while attacking. If the submarine is not detected, then it delivers hits without receiving any damage. If it becomes detected then stealth helps it to escape and lessens the chance of receiving damage.
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_tonnage;The submarine's displacement affects directly its survivability and stealth.
$tooltip_campaign_sub_header_type;Click to arrange the submarines according to their type.
$tooltip_campaign_tech_budget;The more funds you allocate in the “Tech Budget” the faster you research new technologies. You may further speed up the technology research for selected categories by assigning priorities in the “Research” panel.
$tooltip_campaign_transport_capacity;Your nation’s economy and fleet need transport ships in order to function at full potential and effectively replenish fuel and ammo for your warships. This slider determines the policy cost of building more transports. \n\nIf you have “Transport Capacity” higher than 100% your GDP receives bonuses. During war you will start having an economic impact with each loss of transport (TR Losses), if the “Transport Capacity” becomes lower than 100%.
$tooltip_choise_ship_for_refit;Choose ships to refit. You can refit only ships of the same initial class.
$tooltip_con_beam;*Beam*: The width of the hull greatly affects the ship's maneuverability, stability and resistance against hits. A wider hull is a more stable shooting platform and has an increased displacement and resistance but is generally slower, less maneuverable, a larger target and requires significantly more engine horsepower to achieve a reasonable speed.
$tooltip_con_draught;*Draught*: The height of the hull greatly affects the ship's maneuverability, stability and resistance against hits. A taller and consequently a larger hull is a less stable shooting platform but is more resistant against flooding and can carry more load, while the operational range becomes increased by its ability to maintain the cruising speed with less wave resistance.
$tooltip_con_op_range;The Operational *Range* measures how far can the ship travel away from friendly ports without refueling and is determined by the ship’s fuel storage.\n\nAs technology develops, the engines’ fuel consumption becomes more efficient, allowing longer journeys in shorter time, so less ship’s tonnage is needed for fuel tanks and provisions.\n\nThe minimum operational range limits the ship to coastal defense and standard naval duties while higher range gives the capability to participate in distant naval raids, surprise strikes and special missions, making it a much more useful and multi-purpose warship. \n\n+ Increases operational usefulness\n+ Increases probability of convoy raids\n+ Increases probability of favourable naval missions\n+ Decreases maintenance penalty in distant travels \n- Fuel storage and consumption increases ship’s cost\n- Decreases available tonnage
$tooltip_con_speed;*Speed* measured in Knots determines how fast the ship travels on sea and is one of the most important tactical factors in naval warfare. \n\nFast warships can outmaneuver slower enemies or evade and withdraw when needed.\n\nSlow warships will not be able to keep safe distance from torpedo equipped enemies and will be unable to chase weaker targets in order to destroy them.\n\n+ Increases maneuverability\n+ Helps in evading combat and stronger enemies\n+ Helps in chasing weaker enemies\n+ Makes the ship harder to target\n- Engine’s machinery increases ship’s cost\n- Decreases available tonnage
$tooltip_con_surv;*Bulkheads* are reinforced walls that divide the hull’s interior in multiple rooms.\n\nThe amount of bulkheads directly affects the ship’s survivability. When the hull is subdivided in many sections, flooding or fire damage are more easily controlled, while the ship’s citadel is far more protected against shells that penetrate the hull.\n\nThe citadel encloses the machinery and magazine spaces, thus engine damage and ammo detonation become less likely when bulkheads’ division is dense and well armored.\n\n+ Improves overall flooding protection\n+ Improves overall fire protection in sections below the waterline\n+ Reduces probability of engine damage from penetrating shells\n+ Reduces probability of ammo detonation from penetrating shells\n- Increases ship’s cost\n- Decreases available tonnage
$tooltip_con_tonnage;The *Displacement* is the ship’s weight and is expressed in tons of water that its hull displaces.\n\nThe displacement affects how many tons of machinery, armor, armament and other important equipment can be fitted. The more tonnage, the larger and more powerful the ship at the expense of becoming less maneuverable and bigger target.\n\nThe maximum displacement of a hull cannot be exceeded during the design process so this is why you need to carefully utilize the available free space. Be aware that the final build may have flaws and make the ship overweight or lighter than expected.\n\n+ Allows more equipment\n+ Allows more armor\n+ Allows more powerful armament\n+ Increases ship’s structural durability during combat\n- Increases ship’s cost\n- Requires more engine power to achieve high speeds\n- Decreases maneuverability\n- Makes ship a larger target

$tooltip_crew_info_battle_torpedoes;*Torpedoes* Station uses crew from torpedo launchers and affects: Torpedo Reload, Torpedo Accuracy.
$tooltip_crew_info_complement;Crew increases as you add parts to the hull. Quarters further increase the crew numbers according to the setting. The Battle Stations of the ship need a minimum number of crew to be at full efficiency. \n\nIf during the battle there are crew losses that reduce the crew lower than the minimum, then penalties start to apply in the respective station. \n\n“Cramped” quarters support only the minimum number of crew needed. In order to have crew reserves (ship watches) you need to have a higher quarter setting.
$tooltip_crew_info_skills_accuracy;*Accuracy:* increases the base accuracy of guns and torpedoes.
$tooltip_crew_info_skills_aiming;*Aiming:* affects gun ladder aiming and all the procedures needed to find the range and target enemy ships.This skill is uniquely enhanced by the crew training, adding to the aiming bonuses of ship equipment and greatly improves the gun accuracy during a battle.
$tooltip_crew_info_skills_damage_control;*Damage Control:* speeds up fire extinguishment, water pumping, and module repairs.
$tooltip_crew_info_skills_reload_time;*Reload Time:* lessens the time needed to reload guns and torpedoes.
$tooltip_crew_info_training_level;The Crew training skills span from 0 to 100 maximum rating and are categorized in six thresholds: *Cadets, Green, Trained, Regular, Seasoned, Veterans*. \nThe training skills increase as training becomes higher and are the following:\n\n[=] *Accuracy:* increases the base accuracy of guns and torpedoes.\n[=] *Aiming:* affects gun ladder aiming and all the procedures needed to find the range and target enemy ships.This skill is uniquely enhanced by the crew training, adding to the aiming bonuses of ship equipment and greatly improves the gun accuracy during a battle.\n[=] *Reload Time:* lessens the time needed to reload guns and torpedoes.\n[=] *Damage Control:* speeds up fire extinguishment, water pumping, and module repairs.
$tooltip_crew_quarters;Each ship has a crew complement according to its hull and various parts. “Quarters” determine the maximum amount of crew that can be added to the ship, with three available thresholds: *“Cramped”, “Standard”, “Spacious”*.\n\nThe crew services four main battle stations: *Control, Main Guns, Secondary Guns, Torpedoes*. The minimum crew needed for each station must be maintained in order for the ship to operate at its full efficiency. \n\nDuring battle, the ship may start to have crew losses and if a Station begins to have less crew than it minimally needs, penalties start to apply in various aspects of the ship.\n\n[=] *Control* Station uses crew from Main Tower, Secondary Tower, Funnels and affects: Damage Control, Aiming.\n[=] *Main Guns* Station uses crew from Main Guns and their respective barbettes and affects: Main Guns Reload, Main Guns Long Range Accuracy.\n[=] *Sec Guns* Station uses crew from Secondary Guns and their respective barbettes and affects: Secondary Guns Reload, Secondary Guns Long Range Accuracy.\n[=] *Torpedoes* Station uses crew from torpedo launchers and affects: Torpedo Reload, Torpedo Accuracy.
$tooltip_crew_training;The Crew training skills span from 0 to 100 maximum rating and are categorized in six thresholds: *Cadets, Green, Trained, Regular, Seasoned, Veterans*. \nThe training skills increase as training becomes higher and are the following:\n\n[=] *Accuracy:* increases the base accuracy of guns and torpedoes.\n[=] *Aiming:* affects gun ladder aiming and all the procedures needed to find the range and target enemy ships.This skill is uniquely enhanced by the crew training, adding to the aiming bonuses of ship equipment and greatly improves the gun accuracy during a battle.\n[=] *Reload Time:* lessens the time needed to reload guns and torpedoes.\n[=] *Damage Control:* speeds up fire extinguishment, water pumping, and module repairs.\n\nA well trained crew significantly enhances the efficiency of warships, but cannot replace the importance of advanced naval technology. Therefore, when you design ships in Naval Academy and Custom Battles, it is needed to carefully examine the benefits of having numerous and highly trained crew over buying more expensive gear or building more ships.

$tooltip_det_asw;*ASW* (Anti-Submarine Warfare) rating reflects the ability of the ship to trace and destroy submarines. This value is mainly affected by technologies that allow the detection of submarines and is further dependent from the spotting capability and speed of the ship. \n\nAttacking and destroying submarines is accomplished by various means, mainly by "Depth Charges" which are the strongest weapons against them.\n\nShips without ASW are virtually defenseless against a submarine attack.
$tooltip_det_circle;Diameter of the circle travelled on the sea surface to complete a full turn.
$tooltip_det_cruising_speed;The cruising speed is the optimal speed on which the ship achieves fuel efficiency and less vibrations which could affect stability. The engine type and ship design determines this value. Damages of the hull and on the engines reduce it accordingly.

$tooltip_det_minesweep;Ships with minesweeping equipment that are included in a fleet significantly increase the fleet's ability to clean up mines and be protected from mine hits.
$tooltip_det_radar;Technology generation of the installed radar.
$tooltip_det_recon;The *Recon* rating represents the reconnaissance capability of the ship, its ability to report enemy movements without being detected, and greatly improves the strategic power of the fleet to gain initiative on offensive missions or get away from trouble before the enemy comes too close.  \n\n“Recon” is affected mainly by the respective technology as well as spotting, detectability and speed attributes of the ship.\n\nLarge and slow ships such as battleships are expected to have a smaller “Recon” rating than small cruisers and destroyers. Radio and Radar equipment greatly increase the reconnaissance capability surpassing inherited disadvantages of larger ships.
$tooltip_det_rudder_base;Time to change the course of the ship.
$tooltip_det_rudder_full;Time to change course while sailing at top speed.
$tooltip_det_speed;The maximum designed speed of the ship.
$tooltip_det_spot;Spotting bonus from the highest mounted tower.

$tooltip_sections;The highlighted middle area shows the hull sections which are reinforced to support the engine and main gun systems. They weigh more than the aft and fore sections affecting the overall stability of the ship and its structure integrity.\n\nThe underwater sections having the engine rooms are highlighted with a darker red color. When these sections become damaged during battle, the corresponding engines may become damaged. As a result the ship may become significantly slowed down.\n\nIf the ship has armor, the main belt and main deck enclose the highlighted middle area. A special Citadel protection scheme with inner layers can be enabled for extra protection. \n\nThe hull's center of gravity (not containing the ship parts) is displayed with a white line. The white dot shows the height of the center of gravity in relation to the hull, and it can become offset as various design choices affect the total weight of the hull.\n

$tooltip_shell_he;*HE* - Increased damage, increased fire chance, minimum armor penetration.
$tooltip_ship_reverse;*Reverse*\nEnable the reverse engines. While the reverse engines are used and your ship throttle is not zero, your ship will decelerate faster in need to avoid torpedoes or other ships. You might also want to use the reverse engines to maneuver backwards but be warned... engines may become temporarily damaged if you attempt to reverse while travelling at fast speed.
$tooltip_ship_role_defend;Ships that remain in port and are on *Defend* role have the lowest maintenance cost but their activity is minimized very near to their ports, so they are expected to participate only in port defend missions. Furthermore, their power projection is reduced to the minimum, so the enemy can more easily blockade you, if most of your ships are set to "defend".
$tooltip_ship_role_in_being;The *In Being* role is available only to ships which are situated in a port and is useful as a cost effective way to keep a defensive stance for ships stationed at port, since their maintenance is low and can protect their own waters. When ships are sent at Sea their role automatically switches to “Sea Control”.\n\nShips in “In Being” role are less active at sea and thus their power projection rating is reduced. This can be useful to lower tension against other countries but will impact negatively their ability to uplift a blockade.\n
$tooltip_ship_role_invade;The *Invade* role is only available to ships in a task force and maximizes their offensive capability against enemy merchant ships while reducing the defense against enemy attacks on your own transports.\n\nThe “Invade” role is more useful when your task force is operating at distant enemy waters where your own transports are not likely to be found. When using it, it is expected to have more enemy transport sinking per month, but can lead to more losses of your own transports.
$tooltip_ship_role_limited;The *Limited* role is available only during peacetime and is useful for reducing the maintenance of your ships and the tension caused to rival nations. However, the crew training progress is severely penalized, so it will be more difficult to keep your ships at a good training level. When ships are sent to sea, they immediately switch to "Sea Control" role.
$tooltip_ship_role_protect;The *Protect* role is only available to ships in a task force and maximizes their defensive capability against attack on your merchant ships while reducing the offense against enemy transports.\n\nThe “Protect” role is more useful when your task force is operating in your own waters where your own transports need extra protection. When using it, it is expected to have less transport sinkings  by your enemy but you will also sink less enemy transports.\n
$tooltip_ship_role_sea_control;Setting your ships to *Sea Control* increases the radius from which they can interact when based in a port. Furthermore, it increases their activity at sea thus increases their power projection at the cost of a much higher ship maintenance cost.\n\nShips set at ‘Sea Control’ cause the maximum tension during peacetime.\n
$tooltip_shred_designs;*Selective:* AI will use your shared designs after a number of auto-design failed attempts.\n*Always:* AI will use your shared designs in priority when auto-designing a ship.\n*Off:* Your shared designs will not be used for AI auto-design.\n\nThe Shared Designs will not be used if their technology level does not match exactly for the ships that the AI attempts to design.
$tooltip_skirmish_build;Design a single ship type of your fleet. The rest will be auto-designed.
$tooltip_skirmish_clear;Set all ships to zero.
$tooltip_skirmish_random;Setup randomly ships/years/distance.
$tooltip_skirmish_start;Auto-design all ships.
$tooltip_skirmish_unlock;Unlock all nations' hulls of selected year for your fleet.
$tooltip_speed_cruise;Cruise speed, gives accuracy bonus.
$tooltip_speed_slider;Adjust speed
$tooltip_speed_slider_catchup;Some ships in division are unable to reach this speed.
$tooltip_speed_value;Current speed
$tooltip_spread_close;*Tight* - The formation is more strictly maintained. The ships keep a smaller distance between them and can gain an accuracy bonus by sustaining a cruising speed. However, the ships become slower and may be hit with more probability by the enemy. Battleships are using this mode by default.
$tooltip_spread_far;*Loose* - The ships can reach their top speed but their formation may be easily abrupted and targeting often suffers from penalties. Light Cruisers, Destroyers and Torpedo Boats use this mode by default.
$tooltip_spread_normal;*Normal* - A balanced way to keep a formation because ships can achieve higher speeds. Battlecruisers and Heavy Cruisers use this mode by default.
$tooltip_sub_role_defend;The *Defend* role is available only for submarines that stay in port and sets them into minimum activity near the port, significantly reducing their maintenance cost.
$tooltip_sub_role_restricted;The *Restricted* role can be enabled only for submarines at sea. Submarines on a "Restricted" role have increased maintenance compared to "Defend" but their raiding power and attack power are significantly enhanced.
$tooltip_sub_role_unrestricted;Ships on *Unrestricted* role have maximized attack and raid power as well as maintenance cost. The side effect is that they can cause unwanted accidents against civilian or transport ships of neutral nations, something that can drag them into war against us. This role is available only for submarines at sea.

$MissionData_Goal_New_Mission_Patch_v14_1;Attack a Battlecruiser and its escorts with your light cruisers
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_Patch_v14_1;Germany entered the British waters with a powerful battlecruiser and four cruisers. You, as the British, can use only your light cruisers to deal with the threat. According to their design, the modern light cruisers may combine speed, maneuverability and large firepower but can become rather expensive. Utilizing effectively the available technology and money can provide the necessary means for victory.

$MissionData_Goal_New_Mission_Patch_v14_2;Design your main attack force against your enemy
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_Patch_v14_2;An Austro-Hungarian fleet consisting of two new dreadnoughts, a few pre-dreadnoughts and several cruisers is seeking to fight our Italian fleet. We possess some old pre-dreadnoughts, cruisers and destroyers. The rest of the fleet that will consist of the main attack force will be what you choose to design and build. You can focus on building expensive dreadnoughts or numerous ships of smaller displacement.
$MissionData_Name_New_Mission_Patch_v14_3;"What if" against Spain
$MissionData_Goal_New_Mission_Patch_v14_3;What if the Spanish-American War occured later involving more advanced ships
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_Patch_v14_3;The year is 1904 and war broke out, eventually, between the USA and the Spanish Empire. The naval technology evolves rapidly and both nations can form fleets including large pre-dreadnoughts and fast cruisers. A large Spanish armada seeks to fight your US fleet. You have at your disposal cruisers, torpedo boats, destroyers which you can supplement with a specific ship type that will consist of the main force. Your funds are not endless, so there is the dilemma, to build large battleships or more but smaller ships?

$MissionData_Goal_New_Mission_Patch_v14_4;Sink powerful US Battleships with your cruisers
$MissionData_Desc_New_Mission_Patch_v14_4;After World War I, Russia is suffering financially and is unable to construct expensive battleships. The USA threatens the Far East region by sending a fleet including powerful battleships that are, theoretically, too strong for your own fleet. You possess an old armored cruiser, some destroyers and extra cruisers of your design. Your mission is to sink at least two battleships without losing most of your own fleet.

You can choose to fight them with one of your own super battleships or smaller and very expensive ships of your design. Your task is to design the best ship type that can create an attack group within the fund limits and destroy the elite enemies.
