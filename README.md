Naval Arms Race, mod overhaul

 Introduction

Naval Arms Race, or simple "N.A.R.", is a mod overhaul for U.A.D. that reworks several game mechanics with focus in historical accuracy. Adds new nations, ships and rework many others. Other gameplay improvements are also made where it is possible to provide a more enjoyable experience with more interesting choices for the player.

 

Special thanks to “Nick Thomadis” from the U.A.D. team, for all the help and the precious information shared, to "NathanKell" and his brilliant work "TweaksAndFixes" that gave me the tools I needed to expand what it is possible to do, and to all the players that shared feedback. It helped me a lot, some with interesting suggestions, others by reporting bug fixing issues.
