#id,The text name that will appear in the submarine build/design dialogue,Tooltip that will appear when we hover on submarine icon in the fleet management,enabled / disabled,A type that can be used in code to diistinquish from normal hulls,The tonnage of the submarine (we use it autoresolve calcs for damage),The cost of the submarine will be modified from techs and will appear in the build dialogues,Crew that will be used from the crew pool,Determines damage inflicted on enemies,Determines chance to become discovered and attacked by enemies,Affects TR losses per turn for the enemy,Determines chance to survive when discovered,Determines speed on map,Determines range from nearest friendly port that it can  operate,if not 0 then it lays mines on deep sea. By default it is 0,we can define here a special icon for each different hull. By default it will use the same for all subs,"similar in ""parts"" determines which nations can have this hull, by default it is for all","we add here any special params as it works for ""parts""",,,,
